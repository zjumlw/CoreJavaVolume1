Chapter 1. Marseilles¡ªThe Arrival

On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde
signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and
Naples.

As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chateau d¡¯If,
got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean
were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a
ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has
been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an
owner of the city.

The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
Pom¨¨gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but
so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the
forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have
happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly
that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for
she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the
anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by
the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow
entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and
vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each
direction of the pilot.

The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the
vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled
alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La R¨¦serve
basin.

When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his
station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship¡¯s bulwarks.

He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black
eyes, and hair as dark as a raven¡¯s wing; and his whole appearance
bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from
their cradle to contend with danger.

¡°Ah, is it you, Dant¨¨s?¡± cried the man in the skiff. ¡°What¡¯s the matter?
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?¡±

¡°A great misfortune, M. Morrel,¡± replied the young man, ¡°a great
misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
Captain Leclere.¡±

¡°And the cargo?¡± inquired the owner, eagerly.

¡°Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head.
But poor Captain Leclere¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What happened to him?¡± asked the owner, with an air of considerable
resignation. ¡°What happened to the worthy captain?¡±

¡°He died.¡±

¡°Fell into the sea?¡±

¡°No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.¡± Then turning to the
crew, he said, ¡°Bear a hand there, to take in sail!¡±

All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the
owner.

¡°And how did this misfortune occur?¡± inquired the latter, resuming the
interrupted conversation.

0023m


¡°Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the
harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In
twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his
rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head
and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and
cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,¡± added the young man with a
melancholy smile, ¡°to make war against the English for ten years, and to
die in his bed at last, like everybody else.¡±

¡°Why, you see, Edmond,¡± replied the owner, who appeared more comforted
at every moment, ¡°we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the
young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me
that the cargo¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you
not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.¡±

Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
¡°Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!¡±

The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-
of-war.

¡°Let go¡ªand clue up!¡± At this last command all the sails were lowered,
and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.

¡°Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,¡± said Dant¨¨s, observing the
owner¡¯s impatience, ¡°here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of
his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must
look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.¡±

The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
Dant¨¨s flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to
a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to
his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the
owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of
unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to
his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible
agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as
much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dant¨¨s was beloved by them.

¡°Well, M. Morrel,¡± said Danglars, ¡°you have heard of the misfortune that
has befallen us?¡±

¡°Yes¡ªyes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.¡±

¡°And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,
as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as
that of Morrel & Son,¡± replied Danglars.

¡°But,¡± replied the owner, glancing after Dant¨¨s, who was watching the
anchoring of his vessel, ¡°it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so
old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend
Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction
from anyone.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. ¡°Yes,
he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the
captain¡¯s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without
consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the
Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.¡±

0025m


¡°As to taking command of the vessel,¡± replied Morrel, ¡°that was his duty
as captain¡¯s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba,
he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.¡±

¡°The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M.
Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.¡±

¡°Dant¨¨s,¡± said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, ¡°come this
way!¡±

¡°In a moment, sir,¡± answered Dant¨¨s, ¡°and I¡¯m with you.¡± Then calling to
the crew, he said, ¡°Let go!¡±

The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the
port-hole. Dant¨¨s continued at his post in spite of the presence of the
pilot, until this man?uvre was completed, and then he added, ¡°Half-mast
the colors, and square the yards!¡±

¡°You see,¡± said Danglars, ¡°he fancies himself captain already, upon my
word.¡±

¡°And so, in fact, he is,¡± said the owner.

¡°Except your signature and your partner¡¯s, M. Morrel.¡±

¡°And why should he not have this?¡± asked the owner; ¡°he is young, it is
true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.¡±

A cloud passed over Danglars¡¯ brow.

¡°Your pardon, M. Morrel,¡± said Dant¨¨s, approaching, ¡°the vessel now
rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?¡±

Danglars retreated a step or two. ¡°I wished to inquire why you stopped
at the Island of Elba?¡±

¡°I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain
Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.¡±

¡°Then did you see him, Edmond?¡±

¡°Who?¡±

¡°The marshal.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dant¨¨s on one side, he said
suddenly¡ª

¡°And how is the emperor?¡±

¡°Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.¡±

¡°You saw the emperor, then?¡±

¡°He entered the marshal¡¯s apartment while I was there.¡±

¡°And you spoke to him?¡±

¡°Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,¡± said Dant¨¨s, with a smile.

¡°And what did he say to you?¡±

¡°Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the
course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &
Son. ¡®Ah, yes,¡¯ he said, ¡®I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners
from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same
regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.¡¯¡±

¡°Pardieu! and that is true!¡± cried the owner, greatly delighted. ¡°And
that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dant¨¨s,
you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see
it will bring tears into the old soldier¡¯s eyes. Come, come,¡± continued
he, patting Edmond¡¯s shoulder kindly, ¡°you did very right, Dant¨¨s, to
follow Captain Leclere¡¯s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it
were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had
conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.¡±

0027m


¡°How could that bring me into trouble, sir?¡± asked Dant¨¨s; ¡°for I did
not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such
inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the
health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.¡± And the
young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and
said,¡ª

¡°Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his
landing at Porto-Ferrajo?¡±

¡°Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.¡±

¡°Well, so much the better,¡± said the supercargo; ¡°for it is not pleasant
to think that a comrade has not done his duty.¡±

¡°Dant¨¨s has done his,¡± replied the owner, ¡°and that is not saying much.
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.¡±

¡°Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dant¨¨s given you a letter from
him?¡±

¡°To me?¡ªno¡ªwas there one?¡±

¡°I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter
to his care.¡±

¡°Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?¡±

¡°Why, that which Dant¨¨s left at Porto-Ferrajo.¡±

¡°How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?¡±

Danglars turned very red.

¡°I was passing close to the door of the captain¡¯s cabin, which was half
open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dant¨¨s.¡±

¡°He did not speak to me of it,¡± replied the shipowner; ¡°but if there be
any letter he will give it to me.¡±

Danglars reflected for a moment. ¡°Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,¡± said
he, ¡°not to say a word to Dant¨¨s on the subject. I may have been
mistaken.¡±

At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.

¡°Well, my dear Dant¨¨s, are you now free?¡± inquired the owner.

¡°Yes, sir.¡±

¡°You have not been long detained.¡±

¡°No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and
as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I
gave them.¡±

¡°Then you have nothing more to do here?¡±

¡°No¡ªeverything is all right now.¡±

¡°Then you can come and dine with me?¡±

¡°I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to
my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done
me.¡±

0029m


¡°Right, Dant¨¨s, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.¡±

¡°And,¡± inquired Dant¨¨s, with some hesitation, ¡°do you know how my father
is?¡±

¡°Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.¡±

¡°Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.¡±

¡°That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your
absence.¡±

Dant¨¨s smiled. ¡°My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,
I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from
Heaven.¡±

¡°Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on
you.¡±

¡°I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has
been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.¡±

¡°True, Dant¨¨s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who
expects you no less impatiently than your father¡ªthe lovely Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

Dant¨¨s blushed.

¡°Ah, ha,¡± said the shipowner, ¡°I am not in the least surprised, for she
has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the
Pharaon. Peste! Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!¡±

¡°She is not my mistress,¡± replied the young sailor, gravely; ¡°she is my
betrothed.¡±

¡°Sometimes one and the same thing,¡± said Morrel, with a smile.

¡°Not with us, sir,¡± replied Dant¨¨s.

¡°Well, well, my dear Edmond,¡± continued the owner, ¡°don¡¯t let me detain
you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all
the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?¡±

¡°No, sir; I have all my pay to take¡ªnearly three months¡¯ wages.¡±

¡°You are a careful fellow, Edmond.¡±

¡°Say I have a poor father, sir.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your
father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who
detained him from me after a three months¡¯ voyage.¡±

¡°Then I have your leave, sir?¡±

¡°Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.¡±

¡°Nothing.¡±

¡°Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?¡±

¡°He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your
leave of absence for some days.¡±

¡°To get married?¡±

¡°Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.¡±

¡°Very good; have what time you require, Dant¨¨s. It will take quite six
weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until
three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the
Pharaon,¡± added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, ¡°cannot
sail without her captain.¡±

¡°Without her captain!¡± cried Dant¨¨s, his eyes sparkling with animation;
¡°pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes
of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the
Pharaon?¡±

¡°If I were sole owner we¡¯d shake hands on it now, my dear Dant¨¨s, and
call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian
proverb¡ªChi ha compagno ha padrone¡ª¡®He who has a partner has a master.¡¯
But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes.
Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.¡±

¡°Ah, M. Morrel,¡± exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and
grasping the owner¡¯s hand, ¡°M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my
father and of Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

¡°That¡¯s all right, Edmond. There¡¯s a providence that watches over the
deserving. Go to your father; go and see Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and afterwards come
to me.¡±

¡°Shall I row you ashore?¡±

¡°No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars.
Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?¡±

¡°That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you
mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the
day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose
to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle
the dispute¡ªa proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite
right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the
question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you
will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.¡±

¡°But tell me, Dant¨¨s, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be
glad to see Danglars remain?¡±

¡°Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect
for those who possess the owners¡¯ confidence.¡±

¡°That¡¯s right, that¡¯s right, Dant¨¨s! I see you are a thoroughly good
fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you
are.¡±

¡°Then I have leave?¡±

¡°Go, I tell you.¡±

¡°May I have the use of your skiff?¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

¡°Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!¡±

¡°I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.¡±

The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern
sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebi¨¨re. The two
oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly
as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the
narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of
the harbor to the Quai d¡¯Orl¨¦ans.

The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him
spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which
from five o¡¯clock in the morning until nine o¡¯clock at night, swarms in
the famous street of La Canebi¨¨re,¡ªa street of which the modern Phoc¨¦ens
are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with
that accent which gives so much character to what is said, ¡°If Paris had
La Canebi¨¨re, Paris would be a second Marseilles.¡± On turning round the
owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in
reality also watching the young sailor,¡ªbut there was a great difference
in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of
Edmond Dant¨¨s.






Chapter 2. Father and Son

We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and
endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil
suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dant¨¨s, who, after having
traversed La Canebi¨¨re, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small
house, on the left of the All¨¦es de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four
flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while
with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before
a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room.

This room was occupied by Dant¨¨s¡¯ father. The news of the arrival of the
Pharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was
amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and
sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.
Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice
behind him exclaimed, ¡°Father¡ªdear father!¡±

The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he
fell into his arms, pale and trembling.

¡°What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?¡± inquired the young man,
much alarmed.

¡°No, no, my dear Edmond¡ªmy boy¡ªmy son!¡ªno; but I did not expect you; and
joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly¡ªAh, I feel as if I were
going to die.¡±

¡°Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ¡¯Tis I¡ªreally I! They say joy
never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do
smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and
we are going to be happy.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, my boy, so we will¡ªso we will,¡± replied the old man; ¡°but how
shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me all the
good fortune that has befallen you.¡±

¡°God forgive me,¡± said the young man, ¡°for rejoicing at happiness
derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek
this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to
lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable
that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you
understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred
louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor
sailor like me could have hoped for?¡±

¡°Yes, my dear boy,¡± replied the old man, ¡°it is very fortunate.¡±

¡°Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small
house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and
honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?¡±

¡°¡¯Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away¡±¡ªand as he said so the
old man¡¯s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.

¡°Come, come,¡± said the young man, ¡°a glass of wine, father, will revive
you. Where do you keep your wine?¡±

¡°No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,¡± said the
old man.

¡°Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,¡± and he opened two or three
cupboards.

¡°It is no use,¡± said the old man, ¡°there is no wine.¡±

¡°What, no wine?¡± said Dant¨¨s, turning pale, and looking alternately at
the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. ¡°What, no
wine? Have you wanted money, father?¡±

¡°I want nothing now that I have you,¡± said the old man.

¡°Yet,¡± stammered Dant¨¨s, wiping the perspiration from his brow,¡ª¡°yet I
gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little
debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I
did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,
lest he might do you an injury¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Why, I paid him.¡±

¡°But,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, ¡°it was a hundred and forty francs I owed
Caderousse.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± stammered the old man.

¡°And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?¡±

The old man nodded.

¡°So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,¡± muttered
Edmond.

¡°You know how little I require,¡± said the old man.

¡°Heaven pardon me,¡± cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his
father.

¡°What are you doing?¡±

¡°You have wounded me to the heart.¡±

¡°Never mind it, for I see you once more,¡± said the old man; ¡°and now
it¡¯s all over¡ªeverything is all right again.¡±

0035m


¡°Yes, here I am,¡± said the young man, ¡°with a promising future and a
little money. Here, father, here!¡± he said, ¡°take this¡ªtake it, and send
for something immediately.¡± And he emptied his pockets on the table, the
contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six five-franc
pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dant¨¨s brightened.

¡°Whom does this belong to?¡± he inquired.

¡°To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and
tomorrow we shall have more.¡±

¡°Gently, gently,¡± said the old man, with a smile; ¡°and by your leave I
will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy
too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return,
in order to be able to purchase them.¡±

¡°Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I
will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and
most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have
tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.¡±

¡°¡¯Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to
congratulate you on your fortunate return.¡±

¡°Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,¡± murmured
Edmond. ¡°But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on
a time, so he¡¯s welcome.¡±

As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at
the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth,
which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.

¡°What, is it you, Edmond, back again?¡± said he, with a broad
Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.

¡°Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you
in any and every way,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, but ill-concealing his coldness
under this cloak of civility.

¡°Thanks¡ªthanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it
chances that at times there are others who have need of me.¡± Dant¨¨s made
a gesture. ¡°I do not allude to you, my boy. No!¡ªno! I lent you money,
and you returned it; that¡¯s like good neighbors, and we are quits.¡±

¡°We are never quits with those who oblige us,¡± was Dant¨¨s¡¯ reply; ¡°for
when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.¡±

¡°What¡¯s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk of
your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of
mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ¡®You at Marseilles?¡¯¡ª¡®Yes,¡¯
says he.

¡°¡®I thought you were at Smyrna.¡¯¡ª¡®I was; but am now back again.¡¯

¡°¡®And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?¡¯

¡°¡®Why, with his father, no doubt,¡¯ replied Danglars. And so I came,¡±
added Caderousse, ¡°as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking
hands with a friend.¡±

0037m


¡°Worthy Caderousse!¡± said the old man, ¡°he is so much attached to us.¡±

¡°Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are
so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,¡± continued the
tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dant¨¨s
had thrown on the table.

The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of
his neighbor. ¡°Eh,¡± he said, negligently, ¡°this money is not mine. I was
expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my
absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,
father¡± added Dant¨¨s, ¡°put this money back in your box¡ªunless neighbor
Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.¡±

¡°No, my boy, no,¡± said Caderousse. ¡°I am not in any want, thank God, my
living is suited to my means. Keep your money¡ªkeep it, I say;¡ªone never
has too much;¡ªbut, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by
your offer as if I took advantage of it.¡±

¡°It was offered with good will,¡± said Dant¨¨s.

¡°No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I
hear,¡ªyou insinuating dog, you!¡±

¡°M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,¡± replied Dant¨¨s.

¡°Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.¡±

¡°What, did you refuse to dine with him?¡± said old Dant¨¨s; ¡°and did he
invite you to dine?¡±

¡°Yes, my dear father,¡± replied Edmond, smiling at his father¡¯s
astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.

¡°And why did you refuse, my son?¡± inquired the old man.

¡°That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,¡± replied the
young man. ¡°I was most anxious to see you.¡±

¡°But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,¡± said Caderousse.
¡°And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy
the owner.¡±

¡°But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°and I
hope he fully understood it.¡±

¡°Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one¡¯s patrons.¡±

¡°I hope to be captain without that,¡± said Dant¨¨s.

¡°So much the better¡ªso much the better! Nothing will give greater
pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the
Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.¡±

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s?¡± said the old man.

¡°Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and
know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to
go and pay a visit to the Catalans.¡±

¡°Go, my dear boy,¡± said old Dant¨¨s; ¡°and Heaven bless you in your wife,
as it has blessed me in my son!¡±

¡°His wife!¡± said Caderousse; ¡°why, how fast you go on, father Dant¨¨s;
she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.¡±

¡°No, but according to all probability she soon will be,¡± replied Edmond.

¡°Yes¡ªyes,¡± said Caderousse; ¡°but you were right to return as soon as
possible, my boy.¡±

¡°And why?¡±

¡°Because Merc¨¦d¨¨s is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack
followers; she particularly has them by dozens.¡±

¡°Really?¡± answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight
uneasiness.

0039m


¡°Ah, yes,¡± continued Caderousse, ¡°and capital offers, too; but you know,
you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?¡±

¡°Meaning to say,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, with a smile which but ill-concealed
his trouble, ¡°that if I were not a captain¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Eh¡ªeh!¡± said Caderousse, shaking his head.

¡°Come, come,¡± said the sailor, ¡°I have a better opinion than you of
women in general, and of Merc¨¦d¨¨s in particular; and I am certain that,
captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.¡±

¡°So much the better¡ªso much the better,¡± said Caderousse. ¡°When one is
going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but
never mind that, my boy,¡ªgo and announce your arrival, and let her know
all your hopes and prospects.¡±

¡°I will go directly,¡± was Edmond¡¯s reply; and, embracing his father, and
nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.

Caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dant¨¨s, he
went downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of the
Rue Senac.

¡°Well,¡± said Danglars, ¡°did you see him?¡±

¡°I have just left him,¡± answered Caderousse.

¡°Did he allude to his hope of being captain?¡±

¡°He spoke of it as a thing already decided.¡±

¡°Indeed!¡± said Danglars, ¡°he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.¡±

¡°Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.¡±

¡°So that he is quite elated about it?¡±

¡°Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter¡ªhas already offered
me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a
loan of money, as though he were a banker.¡±

¡°Which you refused?¡±

¡°Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I
who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.
Dant¨¨s has no longer any occasion for assistance¡ªhe is about to become a
captain.¡±

¡°Pooh!¡± said Danglars, ¡°he is not one yet.¡±

¡°Ma foi! it will be as well if he is not,¡± answered Caderousse; ¡°for if
he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.¡±

¡°If we choose,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°he will remain what he is; and
perhaps become even less than he is.¡±

¡°What do you mean?¡±

¡°Nothing¡ªI was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the
Catalane?¡±

¡°Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a
storm in that quarter.¡±

0041m


¡°Explain yourself.¡±

¡°Why should I?¡±

¡°It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like Dant¨¨s?¡±

¡°I never like upstarts.¡±

¡°Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.¡±

¡°I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to
believe, as I told you, that the future captain will find some annoyance
in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.¡±

¡°What have you seen?¡ªcome, tell me!¡±

¡°Well, every time I have seen Merc¨¦d¨¨s come into the city she has been
accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red
complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.¡±

¡°Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?¡±

¡°I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean
with a fine wench of seventeen?¡±

¡°And you say that Dant¨¨s has gone to the Catalans?¡±

¡°He went before I came down.¡±

¡°Let us go the same way; we will stop at La R¨¦serve, and we can drink a
glass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.¡±

¡°Come along,¡± said Caderousse; ¡°but you pay the score.¡±

¡°Of course,¡± replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated
place, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.

P¨¨re Pamphile had seen Dant¨¨s pass not ten minutes before; and assured
that he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of
the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were
singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring.






Chapter 3. The Catalans

Beyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot
where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their
wine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony
quitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this
day. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of
its chiefs, who understood Proven?al, begged the commune of Marseilles
to give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of
old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three
months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had
brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up. This
village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish,
half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the
first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three or four
centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on which they
had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with the
Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their original
customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have preserved
its language.

Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village,
and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the beautiful
dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and within
coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and beautiful
girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle¡¯s,
was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender
delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of
which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to
the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved
with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her
arched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her
well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At
three paces from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs,
leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of
twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which
vexation and uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes,
but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.

¡°You see, Merc¨¦d¨¨s,¡± said the young man, ¡°here is Easter come round
again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?¡±

¡°I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be
very stupid to ask me again.¡±

¡°Well, repeat it,¡ªrepeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe
it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had
your mother¡¯s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are
trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.
Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and
to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!¡±

¡°At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,¡±
replied Merc¨¦d¨¨s; ¡°you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry. I
have always said to you, ¡®I love you as a brother; but do not ask from
me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another¡¯s.¡¯ Is not this
true, Fernand?¡±

¡°Yes, that is very true, Merc¨¦d¨¨s,¡± replied the young man, ¡°Yes, you
have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the
Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?¡±

0045m


¡°You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray
of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in the
conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at
any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what would
you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with nothing
but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable inheritance
left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She has been
dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on
public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is an
excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it,
Fernand, because you are the son of my father¡¯s brother, because we were
brought up together, and still more because it would give you so much
pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and
sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,¡ªI feel very
keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.¡±

¡°And if it were, Merc¨¦d¨¨s, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as well
as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of
Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful
housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?¡±

¡°Fernand,¡± answered Merc¨¦d¨¨s, shaking her head, ¡°a woman becomes a bad
manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she
loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my
friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will
promise no more than I can bestow.¡±

¡°I understand,¡± replied Fernand, ¡°you can endure your own wretchedness
patiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Merc¨¦d¨¨s, beloved by
you, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should
become rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a
place as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.¡±

¡°You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you
remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a
fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you more.¡±

¡°Well, I will do better, Merc¨¦d¨¨s. I will be a sailor; instead of the
costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,
a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons. Would
not that dress please you?¡±

¡°What do you mean?¡± asked Merc¨¦d¨¨s, with an angry glance,¡ª¡°what do you
mean? I do not understand you?¡±

¡°I mean, Merc¨¦d¨¨s, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because
you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you
await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.¡±

¡°Fernand,¡± cried Merc¨¦d¨¨s, ¡°I believed you were good-hearted, and I was
mistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the
anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of
whom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of
the inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died loving
me and me only.¡± The young girl made a gesture of rage. ¡°I understand
you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not love you;
you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end would that
answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and see that
friendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me, to seek a
quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that
man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil thoughts. Unable to
have me for your wife, you will content yourself with having me for your
friend and sister; and besides,¡± she added, her eyes troubled and
moistened with tears, ¡°wait, wait, Fernand; you said just now that the
sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four months, and during these
four months there have been some terrible storms.¡±

Fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which
flowed down the cheeks of Merc¨¦d¨¨s, although for each of these tears he
would have shed his heart¡¯s blood; but these tears flowed for another.
He arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping
before Merc¨¦d¨¨s, with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched,¡ª¡°Say,
Merc¨¦d¨¨s,¡± he said, ¡°once for all, is this your final determination?¡±

¡°I love Edmond Dant¨¨s,¡± the young girl calmly replied, ¡°and none but
Edmond shall ever be my husband.¡±

¡°And you will always love him?¡±

¡°As long as I live.¡±

Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was
like a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with
clenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,¡ª¡°But if he is dead¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°If he is dead, I shall die too.¡±

¡°If he has forgotten you¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s!¡± called a joyous voice from without,¡ª¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s!¡±

¡°Ah,¡± exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly
leaping in excess of love, ¡°you see he has not forgotten me, for here he
is!¡± And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, ¡°Here, Edmond,
here I am!¡±

Fernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight of
a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Merc¨¦d¨¨s were
clasped in each other¡¯s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which shot
into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of light.
At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness isolated
them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in broken
words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather
the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and
threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow. By
a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself, the young
Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.

¡°Ah, your pardon,¡± said Dant¨¨s, frowning in his turn; ¡°I did not
perceive that there were three of us.¡± Then, turning to Merc¨¦d¨¨s, he
inquired, ¡°Who is this gentleman?¡±

¡°One who will be your best friend, Dant¨¨s, for he is my friend, my
cousin, my brother; it is Fernand¡ªthe man whom, after you, Edmond, I
love the best in the world. Do you not remember him?¡±

¡°Yes!¡± said Dant¨¨s, and without relinquishing Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡¯ hand clasped in
one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air.
But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture, remained
mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the
agitated and embarrassed Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and then again on the gloomy and
menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.

¡°I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet
an enemy here.¡±

¡°An enemy!¡± cried Merc¨¦d¨¨s, with an angry look at her cousin. ¡°An enemy
in my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my
arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to
return to it no more.¡±

Fernand¡¯s eye darted lightning. ¡°And should any misfortune occur to you,
dear Edmond,¡± she continued with the same calmness which proved to
Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his
sinister thought, ¡°if misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend the
highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from it.¡±

Fernand became deadly pale. ¡°But you are deceived, Edmond,¡± she
continued. ¡°You have no enemy here¡ªthere is no one but Fernand, my
brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.¡±

And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the
Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and
offered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,
was broken against the strong ascendancy which Merc¨¦d¨¨s exercised over
him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond¡¯s hand when he felt he had
done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.

¡°Oh,¡± he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair¡ª¡°Oh, who will
deliver me from this man? Wretched¡ªwretched that I am!¡±

¡°Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?¡± exclaimed a
voice.

The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.

¡°Well¡±, said Caderousse, ¡°why don¡¯t you come? Are you really in such a
hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?¡±

¡°Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,¡± added
Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not
say a word.

¡°He seems besotted,¡± said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.
¡°Are we mistaken, and is Dant¨¨s triumphant in spite of all we have
believed?¡±

¡°Why, we must inquire into that,¡± was Caderousse¡¯s reply; and turning
towards the young man, said, ¡°Well, Catalan, can¡¯t you make up your
mind?¡±

Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to
his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted
body.

¡°Good-day,¡± said he. ¡°You called me, didn¡¯t you?¡± And he fell, rather
than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.

¡°I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid
you would throw yourself into the sea,¡± said Caderousse, laughing. ¡°Why,
when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine,
but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water
unnecessarily!¡±

Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into
his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.

¡°Well, Fernand, I must say,¡± said Caderousse, beginning the
conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which
curiosity destroys all diplomacy, ¡°you look uncommonly like a rejected
lover;¡± and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

¡°Bah!¡± said Danglars, ¡°a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in
love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.¡±

¡°No,¡± he replied, ¡°only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,¡± said
Caderousse, ¡°hold up your head, and answer us. It¡¯s not polite not to
reply to friends who ask news of your health.¡±

¡°My health is well enough,¡± said Fernand, clenching his hands without
raising his head.

¡°Ah, you see, Danglars,¡± said Caderousse, winking at his friend, ¡°this
is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,
one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very
fine girl, named Merc¨¦d¨¨s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine
girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon; and as the Pharaon arrived
today¡ªwhy, you understand!¡±

¡°No; I do not understand,¡± said Danglars.

¡°Poor Fernand has been dismissed,¡± continued Caderousse.

¡°Well, and what then?¡± said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at
Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger;
¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to
love whomsoever she will?¡±

¡°Oh, if you take it in that sense,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°it is another
thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans
were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was
even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.¡±

Fernand smiled piteously. ¡°A lover is never terrible,¡± he said.

¡°Poor fellow!¡± remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from
the bottom of his heart. ¡°Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dant¨¨s
return so suddenly¡ªhe thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance
faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come
suddenly.¡±

¡°Ah, ma foi, under any circumstances!¡± said Caderousse, who drank as he
spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,¡ª¡°under
any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the
fortunate arrival of Dant¨¨s; is he, Danglars?¡±

¡°No, you are right¡ªand I should say that would bring him ill-luck.¡±

¡°Well, never mind,¡± answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for
Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while
Danglars had merely sipped his. ¡°Never mind¡ªin the meantime he marries
Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡ªthe lovely Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡ªat least he returns to do that.¡±

During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on
whose heart Caderousse¡¯s words fell like molten lead.

¡°And when is the wedding to be?¡± he asked.

¡°Oh, it is not yet fixed!¡± murmured Fernand.

¡°No, but it will be,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°as surely as Dant¨¨s will be
captain of the Pharaon¡ªeh, Danglars?¡±

Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,
whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was
premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.

¡°Well,¡± said he, filling the glasses, ¡°let us drink to Captain Edmond
Dant¨¨s, husband of the beautiful Catalane!¡±

Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and
swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.

¡°Eh, eh, eh!¡± stammered Caderousse. ¡°What do I see down there by the
wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are
better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver;
but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in
hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they
are actually embracing!¡±

Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.

¡°Do you know them, Fernand?¡± he said.

¡°Yes,¡± was the reply, in a low voice. ¡°It is Edmond and Merc¨¦d¨¨s!¡±

¡°Ah, see there, now!¡± said Caderousse; ¡°and I did not recognize them!
Hallo, Dant¨¨s! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know when
the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell
us.¡±

¡°Hold your tongue, will you?¡± said Danglars, pretending to restrain
Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the
arbor. ¡°Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without
interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well-
behaved!¡±

0051m


Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the
bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from
his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his
rival, when Merc¨¦d¨¨s, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head,
and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand
recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again
heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after the
other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.

¡°I shall get nothing from these fools,¡± he muttered; ¡°and I am very much
afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Here¡¯s an envious
fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his
wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under
his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes that
glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and Calabrians,
and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow.
Unquestionably, Edmond¡¯s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the
splendid girl¡ªhe will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unless¡±¡ªa
sinister smile passed over Danglars¡¯ lips¡ª¡°unless I take a hand in the
affair,¡± he added.

¡°Hallo!¡± continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the
table, ¡°hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud
to speak to them?¡±

¡°No, my dear fellow!¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°I am not proud, but I am happy,
and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.¡±

¡°Ah, very well, that¡¯s an explanation!¡± said Caderousse. ¡°How do you do,
Madame Dant¨¨s?¡±

Merc¨¦d¨¨s courtesied gravely, and said¡ª¡°That is not my name, and in my
country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the name
of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me Merc¨¦d¨¨s, if
you please.¡±

¡°We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°he is so
easily mistaken.¡±

¡°So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dant¨¨s,¡± said
Danglars, bowing to the young couple.

¡°As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be
arranged at my father¡¯s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
wedding festival here at La R¨¦serve. My friends will be there, I hope;
that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.¡±

¡°And Fernand,¡± said Caderousse with a chuckle; ¡°Fernand, too, is
invited!¡±

¡°My wife¡¯s brother is my brother,¡± said Edmond; ¡°and we, Merc¨¦d¨¨s and I,
should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.¡±

Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and
he could not utter a word.

¡°Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in
a hurry, captain!¡±

¡°Danglars,¡± said Edmond, smiling, ¡°I will say to you as Merc¨¦d¨¨s said
just now to Caderousse, ¡®Do not give me a title which does not belong to
me¡¯; that may bring me bad luck.¡±

¡°Your pardon,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°I merely said you seemed in a hurry,
and we have lots of time; the Pharaon cannot be under weigh again in
less than three months.¡±

¡°We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have
suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I
must go to Paris.¡±

¡°Ah, really?¡ªto Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been
there, Dant¨¨s?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Have you business there?¡±

¡°Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to
what I allude, Danglars¡ªit is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the
time to go and return.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, I understand,¡± said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he
added, ¡°To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal
gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea¡ªa capital idea! Ah; Dant¨¨s,
my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship
Pharaon;¡± then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, ¡°A pleasant
journey,¡± he cried.

¡°Thank you,¡± said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers
continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
elect of heaven.






Chapter 4. Conspiracy

Danglars followed Edmond and Merc¨¦d¨¨s with his eyes until the two lovers
disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas; then,
turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling,
into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-
song.

¡°Well, my dear sir,¡± said Danglars to Fernand, ¡°here is a marriage which
does not appear to make everybody happy.¡±

¡°It drives me to despair,¡± said Fernand.

¡°Do you, then, love Merc¨¦d¨¨s?¡±

¡°I adore her!¡±

¡°For long?¡±

¡°As long as I have known her¡ªalways.¡±

¡°And you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your
condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.¡±

¡°What would you have me do?¡± said Fernand.

¡°How do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle
Merc¨¦d¨¨s; but for you¡ªin the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall
find.¡±

¡°I have found already.¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune
happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.¡±

¡°Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.¡±

¡°You do not know Merc¨¦d¨¨s; what she threatens she will do.¡±

¡°Idiot!¡± muttered Danglars; ¡°whether she kill herself or not, what
matter, provided Dant¨¨s is not captain?¡±

¡°Before Merc¨¦d¨¨s should die,¡± replied Fernand, with the accents of
unshaken resolution, ¡°I would die myself!¡±

¡°That¡¯s what I call love!¡± said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than
ever. ¡°That¡¯s love, or I don¡¯t know what love is.¡±

¡°Come,¡± said Danglars, ¡°you appear to me a good sort of fellow, and hang
me, I should like to help you, but¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°but how?¡±

¡°My dear fellow,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°you are three parts drunk; finish
the bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not meddle
with what we are discussing, for that requires all one¡¯s wit and cool
judgment.¡±

¡°I¡ªdrunk!¡± said Caderousse; ¡°well that¡¯s a good one! I could drink four
more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. P¨¨re
Pamphile, more wine!¡±

And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.

¡°You were saying, sir¡ª¡ª¡± said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the
end of this interrupted remark.

¡°What was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose
the thread of my sentence.¡±

¡°Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it
is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will
extract from their hearts;¡± and Caderousse began to sing the two last
lines of a song very popular at the time:

¡®Tous les m¨¦chants sont buveurs d¡¯eau; C¡¯est bien prouv¨¦ par le
d¨¦luge.¡¯1 ¡°You said, sir, you would like to help me, but¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that Dant¨¨s did
not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,
methinks, and yet Dant¨¨s need not die.¡±

¡°Death alone can separate them,¡± remarked Fernand.

¡°You talk like a noodle, my friend,¡± said Caderousse; ¡°and here is
Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to
you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say
there is no need why Dant¨¨s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he
should. Dant¨¨s is a good fellow; I like Dant¨¨s. Dant¨¨s, your health.¡±

Fernand rose impatiently. ¡°Let him run on,¡± said Danglars, restraining
the young man; ¡°drunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.
Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were
between Edmond and Merc¨¦d¨¨s they would be as effectually separated as if
he lay under a tombstone.¡±

0056m


¡°Yes; but one gets out of prison,¡± said Caderousse, who, with what sense
was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, ¡°and when one gets
out and one¡¯s name is Edmond Dant¨¨s, one seeks revenge¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What matters that?¡± muttered Fernand.

¡°And why, I should like to know,¡± persisted Caderousse, ¡°should they put
Dant¨¨s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.¡±

¡°Hold your tongue!¡± said Danglars.

¡°I won¡¯t hold my tongue!¡± replied Caderousse; ¡°I say I want to know why
they should put Dant¨¨s in prison; I like Dant¨¨s; Dant¨¨s, your health!¡±
and he swallowed another glass of wine.

0057m


Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his
intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, ¡°Well, you understand
there is no need to kill him.¡±

¡°Certainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having
Dant¨¨s arrested. Have you that means?¡±

¡°It is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the
matter? it is no affair of mine.¡±

¡°I know not why you meddle,¡± said Fernand, seizing his arm; ¡°but this I
know, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dant¨¨s, for he who
himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.¡±

¡°I! motives of hatred against Dant¨¨s? None, on my word! I saw you were
unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that¡¯s all; but since you
believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the
affair as best you may;¡± and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.

¡°No, no,¡± said Fernand, restraining him, ¡°stay! It is of very little
consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry
feeling or not against Dant¨¨s. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you
find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,
for Merc¨¦d¨¨s has declared she will kill herself if Dant¨¨s is killed.¡±

Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and
looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, ¡°Kill Dant¨¨s!
who talks of killing Dant¨¨s? I won¡¯t have him killed¡ªI won¡¯t! He¡¯s my
friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I shared
mine with him. I won¡¯t have Dant¨¨s killed¡ªI won¡¯t!¡±

¡°And who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?¡± replied
Danglars. ¡°We were merely joking; drink to his health,¡± he added,
filling Caderousse¡¯s glass, ¡°and do not interfere with us.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, Dant¨¨s¡¯ good health!¡± said Caderousse, emptying his glass,
¡°here¡¯s to his health! his health¡ªhurrah!¡±

¡°But the means¡ªthe means?¡± said Fernand.

¡°Have you not hit upon any?¡± asked Danglars.

¡°No!¡ªyou undertook to do so.¡±

¡°True,¡± replied Danglars; ¡°the French have the superiority over the
Spaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the French invent.¡±

¡°Do you invent, then,¡± said Fernand impatiently.

¡°Waiter,¡± said Danglars, ¡°pen, ink, and paper.¡±

¡°Pen, ink, and paper,¡± muttered Fernand.

¡°Yes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without
my tools I am fit for nothing.¡±

¡°Pen, ink, and paper, then,¡± called Fernand loudly.

¡°There¡¯s what you want on that table,¡± said the waiter.

¡°Bring them here.¡± The waiter did as he was desired.

0059m


¡°When one thinks,¡± said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,
¡°there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at
the corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had more dread of
a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or
pistol.¡±

¡°The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,¡± said Danglars. ¡°Give
him some more wine, Fernand.¡± Fernand filled Caderousse¡¯s glass, who,
like the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and
seized the glass.

The Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh
assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the
table.

¡°Well!¡± resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousse¡¯s
reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.

¡°Well, then, I should say, for instance,¡± resumed Danglars, ¡°that if
after a voyage such as Dant¨¨s has just made, in which he touched at the
Island of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the king¡¯s procureur as
a Bonapartist agent¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I will denounce him!¡± exclaimed the young man hastily.

¡°Yes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront
you with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of
supporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But Dant¨¨s cannot
remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and the
day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his
incarceration!¡±

¡°Oh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a
quarrel with me.¡±

¡°Yes, and Merc¨¦d¨¨s! Merc¨¦d¨¨s, who will detest you if you have only the
misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!¡±

¡°True!¡± said Fernand.

¡°No, no,¡± continued Danglars; ¡°if we resolve on such a step, it would be
much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink, and
write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized) the
denunciation we propose.¡± And Danglars, uniting practice with theory,
wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his usual
style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he handed to
Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:

¡°The honorable, the king¡¯s attorney, is informed by a friend of the
throne and religion, that one Edmond Dant¨¨s, mate of the ship Pharaon,
arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and
Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for the
usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee
in Paris. Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the
letter will be found upon him, or at his father¡¯s, or in his cabin on
board the Pharaon.¡±

¡°Very good,¡± resumed Danglars; ¡°now your revenge looks like common
sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus
work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am
doing, and write upon it, ¡®To the king¡¯s attorney,¡¯ and that¡¯s all
settled.¡± And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.

¡°Yes, and that¡¯s all settled!¡± exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last
effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and
instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must
entail. ¡°Yes, and that¡¯s all settled; only it will be an infamous
shame;¡± and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.

¡°Yes,¡± said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; ¡°and as what I
say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost,
should be sorry if anything happened to Dant¨¨s¡ªthe worthy Dant¨¨s¡ªlook
here!¡± And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw
it into a corner of the arbor.

¡°All right!¡± said Caderousse. ¡°Dant¨¨s is my friend, and I won¡¯t have him
ill-used.¡±

¡°And who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,¡± said
Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained
seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung
into the corner.

¡°In this case,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°let¡¯s have some more wine. I wish
to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

¡°You have had too much already, drunkard,¡± said Danglars; ¡°and if you
continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand
on your legs.¡±

¡°I?¡± said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken
man, ¡°I can¡¯t keep on my legs? Why, I¡¯ll wager I can go up into the
belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!¡±

¡°Done!¡± said Danglars, ¡°I¡¯ll take your bet; but tomorrow¡ªtoday it is
time to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.¡±

¡°Very well, let us go,¡± said Caderousse; ¡°but I don¡¯t want your arm at
all. Come, Fernand, won¡¯t you return to Marseilles with us?¡±

¡°No,¡± said Fernand; ¡°I shall return to the Catalans.¡±

¡°You¡¯re wrong. Come with us to Marseilles¡ªcome along.¡±

¡°I will not.¡±

¡°What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;
there¡¯s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the
young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.¡±

Danglars took advantage of Caderousse¡¯s temper at the moment, to take
him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he
went.

When they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw
Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his
pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.

¡°Well,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°why, what a lie he told! He said he was going
to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are
coming, my boy!¡±

¡°Oh, you don¡¯t see straight,¡± said Danglars; ¡°he¡¯s gone right by the
road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°I should have sworn that he turned to the
right¡ªhow treacherous wine is!¡±

¡°Come, come,¡± said Danglars to himself, ¡°now the thing is at work and it
will effect its purpose unassisted.¡±






Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast

The morning¡¯s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves
into a network of ruby-tinted light.

The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La R¨¦serve, with
whose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for
the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each
of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the
name of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a
wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although the
entertainment was fixed for twelve o¡¯clock, an hour previous to that
time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,
consisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon, and other
personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to
the occasion.

Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon
had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in
doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could
possibly be intended.

Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by
Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had
recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his
intention to dine at La R¨¦serve.

In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an
enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed
the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose
wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in
command of the ship; and as Dant¨¨s was universally beloved on board his
vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding
that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with
their own.

With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched
in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the
arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a
lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.

Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere
they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them,
composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on
the bride, by whose side walked Dant¨¨s¡¯ father; the whole brought up by
Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.

Neither Merc¨¦d¨¨s nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his
countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
sunshine and the presence of each other.

Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty
shake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places
beside Fernand and old Dant¨¨s,¡ªthe latter of whom attracted universal
notice.

The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed
with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but wiry legs
were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,
evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat
depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came
along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged
countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of
the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the
Luxembourg and Tuileries.

Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things
provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to
the Dant¨¨s, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a
faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night;
just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty
outline of a dream.

0065m


As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,
who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten
that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted;
occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance,
and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated
and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like
one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.

Dant¨¨s himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to
the merchant service¡ªa costume somewhat between a military and a civil
garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a
more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.

Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Merc¨¦d¨¨s boasted the same
bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with
the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more
practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath
a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as
to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the
contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed
to say: ¡°If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.¡±

As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La R¨¦serve, M. Morrel
descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and
sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already
given, that Dant¨¨s should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere.
Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of
his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting
her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the
feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose
heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of
several minutes.

¡°Father,¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s, stopping when she had reached the centre of the
table, ¡°sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him
who has ever been as a brother to me,¡± pointing with a soft and gentle
smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst
torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the
dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though
some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.

During this time, Dant¨¨s, at the opposite side of the table, had been
occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was
seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from
Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most
agreeable.

Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages,
and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and
brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel
within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than
rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the delicacies,
in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and
styled by the grateful fishermen ¡°fruits of the sea.¡±

¡°A pretty silence truly!¡± said the old father of the bridegroom, as he
carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the
topaz, and which had just been placed before Merc¨¦d¨¨s herself. ¡°Now,
would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who
desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?¡±

¡°Ah,¡± sighed Caderousse, ¡°a man cannot always feel happy because he is
about to be married.¡±

¡°The truth is,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if
that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are
right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us
almost the same as sorrow.¡±

Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and
betrayed each fresh impression.

¡°Why, what ails you?¡± asked he of Edmond. ¡°Do you fear any approaching
evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this
instant.¡±

¡°And that is the very thing that alarms me,¡± returned Dant¨¨s. ¡°Man does
not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness
is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce,
fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all
shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own
that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I
feel myself unworthy¡ªthat of being the husband of Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

¡°Nay, nay!¡± cried Caderousse, smiling, ¡°you have not attained that honor
yet. Merc¨¦d¨¨s is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of a
husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet
come!¡±

The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start
at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops
of perspiration that gathered on his brow.

¡°Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
contradict me for such a trifle as that. ¡¯Tis true that Merc¨¦d¨¨s is not
actually my wife; but,¡± added he, drawing out his watch, ¡°in an hour and
a half she will be.¡±

A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the
exception of the elder Dant¨¨s, whose laugh displayed the still perfect
beauty of his large white teeth. Merc¨¦d¨¨s looked pleased and gratified,
while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.

¡°In an hour?¡± inquired Danglars, turning pale. ¡°How is that, my friend?¡±

¡°Why, thus it is,¡± replied Dant¨¨s. ¡°Thanks to the influence of M.
Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every
difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the
usual delay; and at half-past two o¡¯clock the Mayor of Marseilles will
be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has
already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying,
that, in another hour and thirty minutes Merc¨¦d¨¨s will have become
Madame Dant¨¨s.¡±

0069m


Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and
he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling
from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain
from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy
felicitations of the company.

¡°Upon my word,¡± cried the old man, ¡°you make short work of this kind of
affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three
o¡¯clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!¡±

¡°But,¡± asked Danglars, in a timid tone, ¡°how did you manage about the
other formalities¡ªthe contract¡ªthe settlement?¡±

¡°The contract,¡± answered Dant¨¨s, laughingly, ¡°it didn¡¯t take long to fix
that. Merc¨¦d¨¨s has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you
see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very
expensive.¡± This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.

¡°So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to
be the actual wedding dinner!¡± said Danglars.

¡°No, no,¡± answered Dant¨¨s; ¡°don¡¯t imagine I am going to put you off in
that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go,
and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission
entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here
by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.¡±

This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to
such a degree, that the elder Dant¨¨s, who, at the commencement of the
repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it
difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment¡¯s
tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride
and bridegroom.

Dant¨¨s, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded
by a look of grateful pleasure; while Merc¨¦d¨¨s glanced at the clock and
made an expressive gesture to Edmond.

Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at
such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social
position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the
commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves
according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more
agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a
reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own
thoughts.

Fernand¡¯s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As
for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and,
as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such
deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther
end of the salon.

Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most
anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.

¡°Upon my word,¡± said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment
of Dant¨¨s, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken
of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dant¨¨s¡¯ good
fortune,¡ª¡°upon my word, Dant¨¨s is a downright good fellow, and when I
see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I
cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him
that trick you were planning yesterday.¡±

¡°Oh, there was no harm meant,¡± answered Danglars; ¡°at first I certainly
did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but
when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as
to become one of his rival¡¯s attendants, I knew there was no further
cause for apprehension.¡± Caderousse looked full at Fernand¡ªhe was
ghastly pale.

¡°Certainly,¡± continued Danglars, ¡°the sacrifice was no trifling one,
when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future
captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take
his place.¡±

¡°Shall we not set forth?¡± asked the sweet, silvery voice of Merc¨¦d¨¨s;
¡°two o¡¯clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter
of an hour.¡±

0071m


¡°To be sure!¡ªto be sure!¡± cried Dant¨¨s, eagerly quitting the table; ¡°let
us go directly!¡±

His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.

At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change
in Fernand¡¯s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an
almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open
windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound
on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the
clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz
as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal
party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled
every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike
stillness prevailed.

The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the
door. The company looked at each other in consternation.

¡°I demand admittance,¡± said a loud voice outside the room, ¡°in the name
of the law!¡± As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened,
and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself,
followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the
most extreme dread on the part of those present.

¡°May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?¡± said M.
Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; ¡°there is
doubtless some mistake easily explained.¡±

¡°If it be so,¡± replied the magistrate, ¡°rely upon every reparation being
made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I
most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be
fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of
Edmond Dant¨¨s?¡±

Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation
he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:

¡°I am he; what is your pleasure with me?¡±

¡°Edmond Dant¨¨s,¡± replied the magistrate, ¡°I arrest you in the name of
the law!¡±

¡°Me!¡± repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, ¡°and wherefore, I pray?¡±

¡°I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons
that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary
examination.¡±

M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He
saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly
well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate
decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold
marble effigy. Old Dant¨¨s, however, sprang forward. There are situations
which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He
prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was
touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, ¡°My worthy
friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has
probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his
cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly
he has given the information required, whether touching the health of
his crew, or the value of his freight.¡±

¡°What is the meaning of all this?¡± inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of
Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.

0073m


¡°How can I tell you?¡± replied he; ¡°I am, like yourself, utterly
bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out
what it is about.¡± Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had
disappeared.

The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling
clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared
effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the
evening before had raised between himself and his memory.

¡°So, so,¡± said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, ¡°this,
then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?
All I can say is, that if it be so, ¡¯tis an ill turn, and well deserves
to bring double evil on those who have projected it.¡±

¡°Nonsense,¡± returned Danglars, ¡°I tell you again I have nothing whatever
to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to
pieces.¡±

¡°No, you did not!¡± answered Caderousse, ¡°you merely threw it by¡ªI saw it
lying in a corner.¡±

¡°Hold your tongue, you fool!¡ªwhat should you know about it?¡ªwhy, you
were drunk!¡±

¡°Where is Fernand?¡± inquired Caderousse.

¡°How do I know?¡± replied Danglars; ¡°gone, as every prudent man ought to
be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,
let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.¡±

During this conversation, Dant¨¨s, after having exchanged a cheerful
shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered
himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, ¡°Make
yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to
clear up, that¡¯s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to
go so far as the prison to effect that.¡±

0075m


¡°Oh, to be sure!¡± responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,
¡°nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.¡±

Dant¨¨s descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed
by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed
by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards
Marseilles.

¡°Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!¡± cried Merc¨¦d¨¨s, stretching out her arms
to him from the balcony.

The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken
heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, ¡°Good-bye, Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡ªwe
shall soon meet again!¡± Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the
turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.

¡°Wait for me here, all of you!¡± cried M. Morrel; ¡°I will take the first
conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word
how all is going on.¡±

¡°That¡¯s right!¡± exclaimed a multitude of voices, ¡°go, and return as
quickly as you can!¡±

This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of
terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old
father and Merc¨¦d¨¨s remained for some time apart, each absorbed in
grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their
eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other¡¯s
arms.

Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of
water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit
down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed
next to the seat on which poor Merc¨¦d¨¨s had fallen half fainting, when
released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dant¨¨s.
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.

¡°He is the cause of all this misery¡ªI am quite sure of it,¡± whispered
Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.

¡°I don¡¯t think so,¡± answered the other; ¡°he¡¯s too stupid to imagine such
a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever
wrought it.¡±

¡°You don¡¯t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,¡± said
Caderousse.

¡°Surely,¡± answered Danglars, ¡°one cannot be held responsible for every
chance arrow shot into the air.¡±

¡°You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody¡¯s
head.¡±

Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every
different form.

¡°What think you, Danglars,¡± said one of the party, turning towards him,
¡°of this event?¡±

¡°Why,¡± replied he, ¡°I think it just possible Dant¨¨s may have been
detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as
contraband.¡±

¡°But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since
you are the ship¡¯s supercargo?¡±

¡°Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the
merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with
cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret¡¯s
warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal¡¯s; that is all I was obliged to
know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.¡±

¡°Now I recollect,¡± said the afflicted old father; ¡°my poor boy told me
yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for
me!¡±

¡°There, you see,¡± exclaimed Danglars. ¡°Now the mischief is out; depend
upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our
absence, and discovered poor Dant¨¨s¡¯ hidden treasures.¡±

Merc¨¦d¨¨s, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover¡¯s
arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst
out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.

¡°Come, come,¡± said the old man, ¡°be comforted, my poor child; there is
still hope!¡±

¡°Hope!¡± repeated Danglars.

¡°Hope!¡± faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his
pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.

¡°Good news! good news!¡± shouted forth one of the party stationed in the
balcony on the lookout. ¡°Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we
shall hear that our friend is released!¡±

Merc¨¦d¨¨s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at
the door. He was very pale.

¡°What news?¡± exclaimed a general burst of voices.

¡°Alas, my friends,¡± replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his
head, ¡°the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.¡±

¡°Oh, indeed¡ªindeed, sir, he is innocent!¡± sobbed forth Merc¨¦d¨¨s.

¡°That I believe!¡± answered M. Morrel; ¡°but still he is charged¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°With what?¡± inquired the elder Dant¨¨s.

¡°With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!¡± Many of our readers
may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the
period at which our story is dated.

A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Merc¨¦d¨¨s; the old man sank
into a chair.

¡°Ah, Danglars!¡± whispered Caderousse, ¡°you have deceived me¡ªthe trick
you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old
man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am
determined to tell them all about it.¡±

¡°Be silent, you simpleton!¡± cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm, ¡°or
I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether Dant¨¨s
be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he quitted
it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any letters or
other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it
not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?¡±

With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the
solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on
Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.

¡°Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,¡± said he, casting a
bewildered look on his companion.

¡°To be sure!¡± answered Danglars. ¡°Let us wait, by all means. If he be
innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no
use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.¡±

¡°Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.¡±

¡°With all my heart!¡± replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so
tractable. ¡°Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for
the present to take their course.¡±

After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and
protector of Merc¨¦d¨¨s, led the girl to her home, while some friends of
Dant¨¨s conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the All¨¦es de Meilhan.

The rumor of Edmond¡¯s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in
circulating throughout the city.

¡°Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?¡± asked M.
Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh
tidings of Dant¨¨s, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he
overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. ¡°Could you have believed such a
thing possible?¡±

¡°Why, you know I told you,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°that I considered the
circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very
suspicious circumstance.¡±

¡°And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?¡±

0079m


¡°Certainly not!¡± returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, ¡°You
understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served
under the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what he
thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the
abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and
yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well
aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the
shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought
most carefully to conceal from all else.¡±

¡°¡¯Tis well, Danglars¡ª¡¯tis well!¡± replied M. Morrel. ¡°You are a worthy
fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor
Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon.¡±

¡°Is it possible you were so kind?¡±

¡°Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dant¨¨s what was his opinion
of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your
post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.¡±

¡°And what was his reply?¡±

¡°That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which
he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship¡¯s owners
would have his preference also.¡±

¡°The hypocrite!¡± murmured Danglars.

¡°Poor Dant¨¨s!¡± said Caderousse. ¡°No one can deny his being a noble-
hearted young fellow.¡±

¡°But meanwhile,¡± continued M. Morrel, ¡°here is the Pharaon without a
captain.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°since we cannot leave this port for the next
three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dant¨¨s
will be set at liberty.¡±

¡°No doubt; but in the meantime?¡±

¡°I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,¡± answered Danglars. ¡°You know
that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain
in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my
services, that upon Edmond¡¯s release from prison no further change will
be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dant¨¨s and myself each to
resume our respective posts.¡±

¡°Thanks, Danglars¡ªthat will smooth over all difficulties. I fully
authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look
carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must
never be allowed to interfere with business.¡±

¡°Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be
permitted to see our poor Edmond?¡±

¡°I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I
shall endeavor to interest in Edmond¡¯s favor. I am aware he is a furious
royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king¡¯s attorney, he is
a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.¡±

¡°Perhaps not,¡± replied Danglars; ¡°but I hear that he is ambitious, and
that¡¯s rather against him.¡±

¡°Well, well,¡± returned M. Morrel, ¡°we shall see. But now hasten on
board, I will join you there ere long.¡±

So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded in
the direction of the Palais de Justice.

0081m


¡°You see,¡± said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, ¡°the turn things have
taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?¡±

¡°Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere
joke should lead to such consequences.¡±

¡°But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but
Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the
room¡ªindeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°that I can answer for, you did not. I
only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed
and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.¡±

¡°Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and
either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not
take the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he
may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting
was disguised.¡±

¡°Then you were aware of Dant¨¨s being engaged in a conspiracy?¡±

¡°Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing
more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the
truth.¡±

¡°Still,¡± argued Caderousse, ¡°I would give a great deal if nothing of the
kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You will
see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.¡±

¡°Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;
and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way? All
we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly
quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that
the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.¡±

¡°Amen!¡± responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to
Danglars, and bending his steps towards the All¨¦es de Meilhan, moving
his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one
whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.

¡°So far, then,¡± said Danglars, mentally, ¡°all has gone as I would have
it. I am, temporarily, commander of the Pharaon, with the certainty of
being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to
hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dant¨¨s being released.
But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,¡± added he with a smile,
¡°she will take her own.¡± So saying, he leaped into a boat, desiring to
be rowed on board the Pharaon, where M. Morrel had agreed to meet him.






Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi

In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand
Cours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being
celebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by
Dant¨¨s. In this case, however, although the occasion of the
entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to
the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the
very flower of Marseilles society,¡ªmagistrates who had resigned their
office during the usurper¡¯s reign; officers who had deserted from the
imperial army and joined forces with Cond¨¦; and younger members of
families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of
exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to
the rank of a god.

The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic
conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions
that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five
centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the
violence of party feeling.

The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held
sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a
small population of five or six thousand souls,¡ªafter having been
accustomed to hear the ¡°Vive Napol¨¦ons¡± of a hundred and twenty millions
of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,¡ªwas looked upon
here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with
France or claim to her throne.

The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military
part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the
women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the
downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that
they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and
cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.

An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and
proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-
M¨¦ran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and
the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses
were elevated in the air ¨¤ l¡¯Anglaise, and the ladies, snatching their
bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral
treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.

¡°Ah,¡± said the Marquise de Saint-M¨¦ran, a woman with a stern, forbidding
eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance, despite her
fifty years¡ª¡°ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us from those
very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the
Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here, that all
true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow the
fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made their
fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not help
admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and
station was truly our ¡®Louis the well-beloved,¡¯ while their wretched
usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their
¡®Napoleon the accursed.¡¯ Am I not right, Villefort?¡±

¡°I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but¡ªin
truth¡ªI was not attending to the conversation.¡±

¡°Marquise, marquise!¡± interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the
toast, ¡°let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one¡¯s wedding
day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry
politics.¡±

¡°Never mind, dearest mother,¡± said a young and lovely girl, with a
profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid
crystal, ¡°¡¯tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to
prevent his listening to what you said. But there¡ªnow take him¡ªhe is
your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my
mother speaks to you.¡±

¡°If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly
caught, I shall be delighted to answer,¡± said M. de Villefort.

¡°Never mind, Ren¨¦e,¡± replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness
that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all
other feelings may be withered in a woman¡¯s nature, there is always one
bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine
of maternal love. ¡°I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was,
that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.¡±

¡°They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,¡±
replied the young man, ¡°and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mahomet
of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
personification of equality.¡±

¡°He!¡± cried the marquise: ¡°Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy¡¯s
sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip
the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my
mind, has usurped quite enough.¡±

0085m


¡°Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right
pedestal¡ªthat of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;
that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vend?me. The only difference
consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these
two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality
that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the
other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,¡± said
Villefort, smiling, ¡°I do not mean to deny that both these men were
revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of
April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being
gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and
that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is
forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites.
Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers¡ªCromwell, for
instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and
advocates.¡±

¡°Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully
revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the
son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.¡± A
deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.

¡°¡¯Tis true, madame,¡± answered he, ¡°that my father was a Girondin, but he
was not among the number of those who voted for the king¡¯s death; he was
an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had
well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father
perished.¡±

¡°True,¡± replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at
the tragic remembrance thus called up; ¡°but bear in mind, if you please,
that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from
diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that
while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled
princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and
that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier
became a senator.¡±

¡°Dear mother,¡± interposed Ren¨¦e, ¡°you know very well it was agreed that
all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.¡±

¡°Suffer me, also, madame,¡± replied Villefort, ¡°to add my earnest request
to Mademoiselle de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s, that you will kindly allow the veil of
oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over
matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the
name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles. He
was¡ªnay, probably may still be¡ªa Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier; I,
on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and style myself de Villefort.
Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away
with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which
has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the
power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from
which it sprung.¡±

¡°Bravo, Villefort!¡± cried the marquis; ¡°excellently well said! Come,
now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to
persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and
forgetfulness of the past.¡±

¡°With all my heart,¡± replied the marquise; ¡°let the past be forever
forgotten. I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it
as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and inflexible
for the future in his political principles. Remember, also, Villefort,
that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict
loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the
past, as I do¡± (and here she extended to him her hand)¡ª¡°as I now do at
your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way
anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much
the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is
known you belong to a suspected family.¡±

¡°Alas, madame,¡± returned Villefort, ¡°my profession, as well as the times
in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully
conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to
merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet.¡±

0087m


¡°Do you, indeed, think so?¡± inquired the marquise.

¡°I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too
near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from
hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of
persons, and assassinations in the lower.¡±

¡°You have heard, perhaps,¡± said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de
Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d¡¯Artois,
¡°that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?¡±

¡°Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,¡± said M. de Saint-
M¨¦ran; ¡°and where is it decided to transfer him?¡±

¡°To Saint Helena.¡±

¡°For heaven¡¯s sake, where is that?¡± asked the marquise.

¡°An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two
thousand leagues from here,¡± replied the count.

¡°So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly
to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,
of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the
sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.¡±

¡°Unfortunately,¡± said Villefort, ¡°there are the treaties of 1814, and we
cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.¡±

¡°Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,¡± responded M. de Salvieux.
¡°There wasn¡¯t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of
shooting the poor Duc d¡¯Enghien.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said the marquise, ¡°it seems probable that, by the aid of the
Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the
vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The
king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of
France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can best
be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every
attempt at conspiracy¡ª¡¯tis the best and surest means of preventing
mischief.¡±

¡°Unfortunately, madame,¡± answered Villefort, ¡°the strong arm of the law
is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.¡±

¡°Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.¡±

¡°Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it can
do is to avenge the wrong done.¡±

¡°Oh, M. de Villefort,¡± cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to the
Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-
M¨¦ran, ¡°do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles.
I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very amusing!¡±

¡°Amusing, certainly,¡± replied the young man, ¡°inasmuch as, instead of
shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre,
you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress¡ªa drama of
life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed,
instead of¡ªas is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy¡ªgoing home
to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he
may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,¡ªis removed from your sight
merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the
executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to
bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should
any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you
the choice of being present.¡±

¡°For shame, M. de Villefort!¡± said Ren¨¦e, becoming quite pale; ¡°don¡¯t
you see how you are frightening us?¡ªand yet you laugh.¡±

¡°What would you have? ¡¯Tis like a duel. I have already recorded sentence
of death, five or six times, against the movers of political
conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened,
and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?¡±

¡°Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,¡± said Ren¨¦e, becoming more and more
terrified; ¡°you surely are not in earnest.¡±

¡°Indeed I am,¡± replied the young magistrate with a smile; ¡°and in the
interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would
only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as
is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon¡ªwell, can you
expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his
commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will
scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be
his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely
because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one
requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in
order to lash one¡¯s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power.
I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as
though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale,
agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my
eloquence.¡± Ren¨¦e uttered a smothered exclamation.

¡°Bravo!¡± cried one of the guests; ¡°that is what I call talking to some
purpose.¡±

¡°Just the person we require at a time like the present,¡± said a second.

¡°What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear
Villefort!¡± remarked a third; ¡°I mean the trial of the man for murdering
his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid
his hand upon him.¡±

¡°Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,¡± interposed
Ren¨¦e, ¡°it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor
unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed
themselves up in political intrigues¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for,
don¡¯t you see, Ren¨¦e, the king is the father of his people, and he who
shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent
of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great
scale?¡±

¡°I don¡¯t know anything about that,¡± replied Ren¨¦e; ¡°but, M. de
Villefort, you have promised me¡ªhave you not?¡ªalways to show mercy to
those I plead for.¡±

¡°Make yourself quite easy on that point,¡± answered Villefort, with one
of his sweetest smiles; ¡°you and I will always consult upon our
verdicts.¡±

¡°My love,¡± said the marquise, ¡°attend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and
embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays
the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the
badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in
point.¡±

¡°Cedant arma tog?,¡± said Villefort with a bow.

¡°I cannot speak Latin,¡± responded the marquise.

¡°Well,¡± said Ren¨¦e, ¡°I cannot help regretting you had not chosen some
other profession than your own¡ªa physician, for instance. Do you know I
always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel?¡±

¡°Dear, good Ren¨¦e,¡± whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable
tenderness on the lovely speaker.

¡°Let us hope, my child,¡± cried the marquis, ¡°that M. de Villefort may
prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he will
have achieved a noble work.¡±

¡°And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father¡¯s
conduct,¡± added the incorrigible marquise.

¡°Madame,¡± replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, ¡°I have already had
the honor to observe that my father has¡ªat least, I hope so¡ªabjured his
past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous
friend to religion and order¡ªa better royalist, possibly, than his son;
for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse
than warm, decided preference and conviction.¡± Having made this well-
turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of
his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench
in open court.

¡°Do you know, my dear Villefort,¡± cried the Comte de Salvieux, ¡°that is
exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when
questioned by his majesty¡¯s principal chamberlain touching the
singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the
daughter of an officer of the Duc de Cond¨¦; and I assure you he seemed
fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences
was based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who,
without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted
us by saying, ¡®Villefort¡¯¡ªobserve that the king did not pronounce the
word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on
that of Villefort¡ª¡®Villefort,¡¯ said his majesty, ¡®is a young man of
great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his
profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that
he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de
Saint-M¨¦ran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the
noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.¡¯¡±

¡°Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express
himself so favorably of me?¡± asked the enraptured Villefort.

¡°I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he
will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to
him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your
espousing his daughter.¡±

0091m


¡°That is true,¡± answered the marquis.

¡°How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do to
evince my earnest gratitude!¡±

¡°That is right,¡± cried the marquise. ¡°I love to see you thus. Now, then,
were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.¡±

¡°For my part, dear mother,¡± interposed Ren¨¦e, ¡°I trust your wishes will
not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor
debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort¡¯s hands,¡ªthen
I shall be contented.¡±

¡°Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be
called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of
wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to
see me the king¡¯s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent
and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to
the physician.¡±

At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort¡¯s wish had
sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and
whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table
and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however,
returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Ren¨¦e regarded him with
fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then
were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite
the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and
intelligent lover.

¡°You were wishing just now,¡± said Villefort, addressing her, ¡°that I
were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the
disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in
1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my
betrothal.¡±

¡°And wherefore were you called away just now?¡± asked Mademoiselle de
Saint-M¨¦ran, with an air of deep interest.

¡°For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the
executioner.¡±

¡°How dreadful!¡± exclaimed Ren¨¦e, turning pale.

¡°Is it possible?¡± burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to
the magistrate to hear his words.

¡°Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy
has just been discovered.¡±

¡°Can I believe my ears?¡± cried the marquise.

¡°I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,¡± said
Villefort:

¡°¡®The king¡¯s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the
religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dant¨¨s,
mate of the ship Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having
touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter
from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from
the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of
this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond
Dant¨¨s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has
it at his father¡¯s abode. Should it not be found in the possession of
father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin
belonging to the said Dant¨¨s on board the Pharaon.¡¯¡±

¡°But,¡± said Ren¨¦e, ¡°this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous
scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king¡¯s attorney.¡±

0093m


¡°True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders,
opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me, but
not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for
arresting the accused party.¡±

¡°Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?¡± said the marquise.

¡°Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet
pronounce him guilty.¡±

¡°He is in safe custody,¡± answered Villefort; ¡°and rely upon it, if the
letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again,
unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.¡±

¡°And where is the unfortunate being?¡± asked Ren¨¦e.

¡°He is at my house.¡±

¡°Come, come, my friend,¡± interrupted the marquise, ¡°do not neglect your
duty to linger with us. You are the king¡¯s servant, and must go wherever
that service calls you.¡±

¡°Oh, Villefort!¡± cried Ren¨¦e, clasping her hands, and looking towards
her lover with piteous earnestness, ¡°be merciful on this the day of our
betrothal.¡±

The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair
pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:

¡°To give you pleasure, my sweet Ren¨¦e, I promise to show all the lenity
in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero
prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his
head to be cut off.¡±

Ren¨¦e shuddered at the word cut, for the growth in question had a head.

¡°Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,¡± said the marquise. ¡°She will
soon get over these things.¡± So saying, Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran extended
her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law¡¯s
respectful salute on it, looked at Ren¨¦e, as much as to say, ¡°I must try
and fancy ¡¯tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.¡±

¡°These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,¡± sighed poor
Ren¨¦e.

¡°Upon my word, child!¡± exclaimed the angry marquise, ¡°your folly exceeds
all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly
be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!¡±

¡°Oh, mother!¡± murmured Ren¨¦e.

¡°Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you that
to make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;¡±
then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say,
¡°Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy,¡±
and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, Villefort departed
with paradise in his heart.






Chapter 7. The Examination

No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of
a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in
spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a
finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no
means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the
recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which
might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his
own career, G¨¦rard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already
rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He
was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not
passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king;
and besides her personal attractions, which were very great,
Mademoiselle de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s family possessed considerable political
influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry of
his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the
prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her
father¡¯s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling
of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its
contemplation.

At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to
earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, ¡°I
have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this
man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the
conspiracy.¡±

¡°We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers
found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself
is named Edmond Dant¨¨s, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon,
trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &
Son, of Marseilles.¡±

¡°Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the
marines?¡±

¡°Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.¡±

¡°How old?¡±

¡°Nineteen or twenty at the most.¡±

At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue
des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him,
approached; it was M. Morrel.

¡°Ah, M. de Villefort,¡± cried he, ¡°I am delighted to see you. Some of
your people have committed the strangest mistake¡ªthey have just arrested
Edmond Dant¨¨s, mate of my vessel.¡±

¡°I know it, monsieur,¡± replied Villefort, ¡°and I am now going to examine
him.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, ¡°you do not know him,
and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the
world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all
the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for
him.¡±

Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and
replied coldly:

¡°You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in
private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be,
politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?¡±

The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply
them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the
heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of
indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear
on politics; besides, what Dant¨¨s had told him of his interview with the
grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He
replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:

¡°I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and
equitable, and give him back to us soon.¡± This give us sounded
revolutionary in the deputy¡¯s ears.

¡°Ah, ah,¡± murmured he, ¡°is Dant¨¨s then a member of some Carbonari
society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if
I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.¡±
Then he added, ¡°Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty
impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to
me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch,
impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.¡±

0097m


As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the
Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the
shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had
left him. The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in
the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the
prisoner. Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at
Dant¨¨s, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared,
saying, ¡°Bring in the prisoner.¡±

Rapid as had been Villefort¡¯s glance, it had served to give him an idea
of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence
in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and
frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
Villefort¡¯s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often
warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the
impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled,
therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his
features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after
Dant¨¨s entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his
judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been
in M. Morrel¡¯s salon. It was then that he encountered for the first time
Villefort¡¯s look,¡ªthat look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while
seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.

¡°Who and what are you?¡± demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of
papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police
agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour¡¯s
time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt
espionage of which ¡°the accused¡± is always made the victim.

¡°My name is Edmond Dant¨¨s,¡± replied the young man calmly; ¡°I am mate of
the Pharaon, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.¡±

¡°Your age?¡± continued Villefort.

¡°Nineteen,¡± returned Dant¨¨s.

¡°What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?¡±

¡°I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,¡± said the young man,
his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that
happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great
was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the
radiant face of Merc¨¦d¨¨s.

¡°You were at the festival of your marriage?¡± said the deputy, shuddering
in spite of himself.

¡°Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been
attached to for three years.¡± Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck
with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dant¨¨s, surprised in
the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own
bosom¡ªhe also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned
from his own happiness to destroy that of another. ¡°This philosophic
reflection,¡± thought he, ¡°will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-
M¨¦ran¡¯s;¡± and he arranged mentally, while Dant¨¨s awaited further
questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for
eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dant¨¨s.

0099m


¡°Go on, sir,¡± said he.

¡°What would you have me say?¡±

¡°Give all the information in your power.¡±

¡°Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I
know; only,¡± added he, with a smile, ¡°I warn you I know very little.¡±

¡°Have you served under the usurper?¡±

¡°I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.¡±

¡°It is reported your political opinions are extreme,¡± said Villefort,
who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this
inquiry, as if it were an accusation.

¡°My political opinions!¡± replied Dant¨¨s. ¡°Alas, sir, I never had any
opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.
If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus
all my opinions¡ªI will not say public, but private¡ªare confined to these
three sentiments,¡ªI love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore
Merc¨¦d¨¨s. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how
uninteresting it is.¡± As Dant¨¨s spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous
and open countenance, and recollected the words of Ren¨¦e, who, without
knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With
the deputy¡¯s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man
uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he
was scarcely a man,¡ªsimple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the
heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,
because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked
good¡ªextended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort¡¯s
severe look and stern accent. Dant¨¨s seemed full of kindness.

¡°Pardieu!¡± said Villefort, ¡°he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain
Ren¨¦e¡¯s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on
me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet
kiss in private.¡± Full of this idea, Villefort¡¯s face became so joyous,
that when he turned to Dant¨¨s, the latter, who had watched the change on
his physiognomy, was smiling also.

¡°Sir,¡± said Villefort, ¡°have you any enemies, at least, that you know.¡±

¡°I have enemies?¡± replied Dant¨¨s; ¡°my position is not sufficiently
elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too
hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve
sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that they
love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an
elder brother.¡±

¡°But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at
nineteen¡ªan elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who
loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the
envy of someone.¡±

¡°You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may
possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my
acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced
to hate them.¡±

¡°You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You
seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty
to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the
paper; do you know the writing?¡± As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter
from his pocket, and presented it to Dant¨¨s. Dant¨¨s read it. A cloud
passed over his brow as he said:

¡°No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain.
Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,¡± added he, looking
gratefully at Villefort, ¡°to be examined by such a man as you; for this
envious person is a real enemy.¡± And by the rapid glance that the young
man¡¯s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath
this mildness.

¡°Now,¡± said the deputy, ¡°answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a
judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what
truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?¡±
And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dant¨¨s had just
given back to him.

¡°None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a
sailor, by my love for Merc¨¦d¨¨s, by the life of my father¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Speak, monsieur,¡± said Villefort. Then, internally, ¡°If Ren¨¦e could see
me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a
decapitator.¡±

¡°Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain
fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at
Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to
such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying,
he called me to him. ¡®My dear Dant¨¨s,¡¯ said he, ¡®swear to perform what I
am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.¡¯

¡°¡®I swear, captain,¡¯ replied I.

¡°¡®Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume
the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-
Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter¡ªperhaps they
will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You will
accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit
from it.¡¯

¡°¡®I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the
grand-marshal¡¯s presence as easily as you expect?¡¯

¡°¡®Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every
difficulty,¡¯ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was
time¡ªtwo hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.¡±

¡°And what did you do then?¡±

¡°What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my
place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with
a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for
the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to
remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found
some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the
ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted.
He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere¡¯s death; and, as the latter
had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I
undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed
here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my
affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.
Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at
my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and
tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this
charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Villefort, ¡°this seems to me the truth. If you have been
culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the
orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from Elba,
and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and
rejoin your friends.

¡°I am free, then, sir?¡± cried Dant¨¨s joyfully.

¡°Yes; but first give me this letter.¡±

¡°You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I
see in that packet.¡±

¡°Stop a moment,¡± said the deputy, as Dant¨¨s took his hat and gloves. ¡°To
whom is it addressed?¡±

¡°To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-H¨¦ron, Paris.¡± Had a thunderbolt fallen
into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He sank
into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal
letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.

¡°M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-H¨¦ron, No. 13,¡± murmured he, growing still paler.

¡°Yes,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°do you know him?¡±

¡°No,¡± replied Villefort; ¡°a faithful servant of the king does not know
conspirators.¡±

0103m


¡°It is a conspiracy, then?¡± asked Dant¨¨s, who after believing himself
free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. ¡°I have, however, already told
you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.¡±

¡°Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,¡±
said Villefort.

¡°I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.¡±

¡°Have you shown this letter to anyone?¡± asked Villefort, becoming still
more pale.

¡°To no one, on my honor.¡±

¡°Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the
Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?¡±

¡°Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.¡±

¡°And that was too much, far too much,¡± murmured Villefort. Villefort¡¯s
brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled
Dant¨¨s with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered
his face with his hands.

¡°Oh,¡± said Dant¨¨s timidly, ¡°what is the matter?¡± Villefort made no
answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and
again perused the letter.

¡°And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?¡±

¡°I give you my word of honor, sir,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°but what is the
matter? You are ill¡ªshall I ring for assistance?¡ªshall I call?¡±

¡°No,¡± said Villefort, rising hastily; ¡°stay where you are. It is for me
to give orders here, and not you.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± replied Dant¨¨s proudly, ¡°it was only to summon assistance
for you.¡±

¡°I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;
answer me.¡± Dant¨¨s waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort
fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with
perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.

¡°Oh, if he knows the contents of this!¡± murmured he, ¡°and that Noirtier
is the father of Villefort, I am lost!¡± And he fixed his eyes upon
Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.

¡°Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,¡± cried he, suddenly.

¡°In heaven¡¯s name!¡± cried the unhappy young man, ¡°if you doubt me,
question me; I will answer you.¡± Villefort made a violent effort, and in
a tone he strove to render firm:

¡°Sir,¡± said he, ¡°I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you
immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial
justice; what my own feeling is you already know.¡±

¡°Oh, monsieur,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, ¡°you have been rather a friend than a
judge.¡±

0105m


¡°Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it
as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,
and you see¡ª¡ª¡± Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited
until it was entirely consumed.

¡°You see, I destroy it?¡±

¡°Oh,¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s, ¡°you are goodness itself.¡±

¡°Listen,¡± continued Villefort; ¡°you can now have confidence in me after
what I have done.¡±

¡°Oh, command, and I will obey.¡±

¡°Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.¡±

¡°Speak, and I will follow your advice.¡±

¡°I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should
anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but do
not breathe a word of this letter.¡±

¡°I promise.¡± It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner
who reassured him.

¡°You see,¡± continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of
burnt paper fluttered in the flames, ¡°the letter is destroyed; you and I
alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny
all knowledge of it¡ªdeny it boldly, and you are saved.¡±

¡°Be satisfied; I will deny it.¡±

¡°It was the only letter you had?¡±

¡°It was.¡±

¡°Swear it.¡±

¡°I swear it.¡±

Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words
in his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.

¡°Follow him,¡± said Villefort to Dant¨¨s. Dant¨¨s saluted Villefort and
retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself half-
fainting into a chair.

¡°Alas, alas,¡± murmured he, ¡°if the procureur himself had been at
Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have
destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always
interfere with my successes?¡± Suddenly a light passed over his face, a
smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in
thought.

¡°This will do,¡± said he, ¡°and from this letter, which might have ruined
me, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand.¡± And after
having assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur
hastened to the house of his betrothed.

Chapter 8. The Chateau d¡¯If

The commissary of police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign
to two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dant¨¨s¡¯ right and the
other on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice
was opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,
whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais de
Justice communicated with the prison,¡ªa sombre edifice, that from its
grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After
numberless windings, Dant¨¨s saw a door with an iron wicket. The
commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming
to Dant¨¨s as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes
gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind
him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,¡ªhe
was in prison.

He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and
its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words
of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in
his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o¡¯clock when Dant¨¨s was
placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and
the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the
acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to
the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died
away, and Dant¨¨s sank again into his seat. At last, about ten o¡¯clock,
and just as Dant¨¨s began to despair, steps were heard in the corridor, a
key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the massy oaken door flew
open, and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment.

By the torchlight Dant¨¨s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four
gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this
display of force.

¡°Are you come to fetch me?¡± asked he.

¡°Yes,¡± replied a gendarme.

¡°By the orders of the deputy procureur?¡±

¡°I believe so.¡± The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort
relieved all Dant¨¨s¡¯ apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed
himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the
coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.

¡°Is this carriage for me?¡± said Dant¨¨s.

¡°It is for you,¡± replied a gendarme.

Dant¨¨s was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having
neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and
was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others
took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the
stones.

The prisoner glanced at the windows¡ªthey were grated; he had changed his
prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither. Through
the grating, however, Dant¨¨s saw they were passing through the Rue
Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the
quay. Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.

The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse,
a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dant¨¨s saw the
reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.

¡°Can all this force be summoned on my account?¡± thought he.

The officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking a
word, answered Dant¨¨s¡¯ question; for he saw between the ranks of the
soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two
gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered
to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.
They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a
chain, near the quay.

The soldiers looked at Dant¨¨s with an air of stupid curiosity. In an
instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the
gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent
the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the
Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the
port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dant¨¨s knew, in the
Frioul and outside the inner harbor.

The prisoner¡¯s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure
air¡ªfor air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La
R¨¦serve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the
open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dant¨¨s folded his
hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.

0111m


The boat continued her voyage. They had passed the T¨ºte de Mort, were
now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This
man?uvre was incomprehensible to Dant¨¨s.

¡°Whither are you taking me?¡± asked he.

¡°You will soon know.¡±

¡°But still¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°We are forbidden to give you any explanation.¡± Dant¨¨s, trained in
discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question
subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.

The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they
were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor
outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on
some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to
handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy,
who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce
the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not
Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof
against him?

He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.

They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the
right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the
prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it
was there Merc¨¦d¨¨s dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn
Merc¨¦d¨¨s that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?

One light alone was visible; and Dant¨¨s saw that it came from Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡¯
chamber. Merc¨¦d¨¨s was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud
cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter
it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?

He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but
the prisoner thought only of Merc¨¦d¨¨s. An intervening elevation of land
hid the light. Dant¨¨s turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.
While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and
hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.

In spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dant¨¨s turned to the
nearest gendarme, and taking his hand,

¡°Comrade,¡± said he, ¡°I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell
me where we are going. I am Captain Dant¨¨s, a loyal Frenchman, thought
accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I promise
you on my honor I will submit to my fate.¡±

The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for
answer a sign that said, ¡°I see no great harm in telling him now,¡± and
the gendarme replied:

¡°You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know
where you are going?¡±

¡°On my honor, I have no idea.¡±

¡°Have you no idea whatever?¡±

¡°None at all.¡±

¡°That is impossible.¡±

¡°I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.¡±

¡°But my orders.¡±

¡°Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten
minutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if I
intended.¡±

¡°Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must
know.¡±

¡°I do not.¡±

¡°Look round you then.¡± Dant¨¨s rose and looked forward, when he saw rise
within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which
stands the Chateau d¡¯If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than
three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to
Dant¨¨s like a scaffold to a malefactor.

¡°The Chateau d¡¯If?¡± cried he, ¡°what are we going there for?¡±

The gendarme smiled.

¡°I am not going there to be imprisoned,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°it is only used
for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any
magistrates or judges at the Chateau d¡¯If?¡±

¡°There are only,¡± said the gendarme, ¡°a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,
and good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you will
make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.¡±

Dant¨¨s pressed the gendarme¡¯s hand as though he would crush it.

¡°You think, then,¡± said he, ¡°that I am taken to the Chateau d¡¯If to be
imprisoned there?¡±

¡°It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.¡±

¡°Without any inquiry, without any formality?¡±

¡°All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already
made.¡±

¡°And so, in spite of M. de Villefort¡¯s promises?¡±

¡°I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,¡± said the gendarme,
¡°but I know we are taking you to the Chateau d¡¯If. But what are you
doing? Help, comrades, help!¡±

By a rapid movement, which the gendarme¡¯s practiced eye had perceived,
Dant¨¨s sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four
vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat. He
fell back cursing with rage.

¡°Good!¡± said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; ¡°this is the
way you keep your word as a sailor! Believe soft-spoken gentlemen again!
Hark ye, my friend, I have disobeyed my first order, but I will not
disobey the second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.¡± And
he levelled his carbine at Dant¨¨s, who felt the muzzle against his
temple.

For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending
the unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M.
de Villefort¡¯s promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of a
gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing his
teeth and wringing his hands with fury.

At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of
the sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley,
and Dant¨¨s guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they
were mooring the boat.

His guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,
and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress,
while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed
behind.

Dant¨¨s made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw soldiers
drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a
flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and
that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through a
mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier against
freedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair.

They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his
thoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls;
he heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the
light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine.

They waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dant¨¨s could not escape, the
gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders came.

¡°Where is the prisoner?¡± said a voice.

¡°Here,¡± replied the gendarmes.

¡°Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell.¡±

¡°Go!¡± said the gendarmes, thrusting Dant¨¨s forward.

The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under
ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with
tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and
showed Dant¨¨s the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill-
clothed, and of sullen appearance.

0113m


¡°Here is your chamber for tonight,¡± said he. ¡°It is late, and the
governor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you. In the
meantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a
prisoner can wish for. Goodnight.¡± And before Dant¨¨s could open his
mouth¡ªbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the
water¡ªbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the
jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,
leaving stamped upon the prisoner¡¯s mind the dim reflection of the
dripping walls of his dungeon.

Dant¨¨s was alone in darkness and in silence¡ªcold as the shadows that he
felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the
jailer returned, with orders to leave Dant¨¨s where he was. He found the
prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with
weeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The jailer
advanced; Dant¨¨s appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on the
shoulder. Edmond started.

¡°Have you not slept?¡± said the jailer.

¡°I do not know,¡± replied Dant¨¨s. The jailer stared.

¡°Are you hungry?¡± continued he.

¡°I do not know.¡±

¡°Do you wish for anything?¡±

¡°I wish to see the governor.¡±

The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber.

Dant¨¨s followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands towards
the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst forth; he
cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what
crime he had committed that he was thus punished.

The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and round
the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular
tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so
still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,
thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained
the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish
vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Merc¨¦d¨¨s and his father could
have joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live¡ªgood seamen
are welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like
a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Merc¨¦d¨¨s and his
father, whereas he was now confined in the Chateau d¡¯If, that
impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and
Merc¨¦d¨¨s; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort¡¯s promise.
The thought was maddening, and Dant¨¨s threw himself furiously down on
his straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.

¡°Well,¡± said the jailer, ¡°are you more reasonable today?¡± Dant¨¨s made no
reply.

¡°Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?¡±

¡°I wish to see the governor.¡±

¡°I have already told you it was impossible.¡±

¡°Why so?¡±

¡°Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for
it.¡±

¡°What is allowed, then?¡±

¡°Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.¡±

¡°I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to
walk about; but I wish to see the governor.¡±

¡°If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any
more to eat.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± said Edmond, ¡°if you do not, I shall die of hunger¡ªthat is
all.¡±

The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every
prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more
subdued tone.

¡°What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will
be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and
if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.¡±

¡°But,¡± asked Dant¨¨s, ¡°how long shall I have to wait?¡±

¡°Ah, a month¡ªsix months¡ªa year.¡±

¡°It is too long a time. I wish to see him at once.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the jailer, ¡°do not always brood over what is impossible, or
you will be mad in a fortnight.¡±

¡°You think so?¡±

¡°Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of
francs to the governor for his liberty that an abb¨¦ became mad, who was
in this chamber before you.¡±

0119m


¡°How long has he left it?¡±

¡°Two years.¡±

¡°Was he liberated, then?¡±

¡°No; he was put in a dungeon.¡±

¡°Listen!¡± said Dant¨¨s. ¡°I am not an abb¨¦, I am not mad; perhaps I shall
be, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make you another
offer.¡±

¡°What is that?¡±

¡°I do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will give
you a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you will
seek out a young girl named Merc¨¦d¨¨s, at the Catalans, and give her two
lines from me.¡±

0120m


¡°If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is
worth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to
run such a risk for three hundred.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°mark this; if you refuse at least to tell Merc¨¦d¨¨s
I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and when you
enter I will dash out your brains with this stool.¡±

¡°Threats!¡± cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the
defensive; ¡°you are certainly going mad. The abb¨¦ began like you, and in
three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but, fortunately,
there are dungeons here.¡±

Dant¨¨s whirled the stool round his head.

¡°All right, all right,¡± said the jailer; ¡°all right, since you will have
it so. I will send word to the governor.¡±

¡°Very well,¡± returned Dant¨¨s, dropping the stool and sitting on it as if
he were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in an instant
with a corporal and four soldiers.

¡°By the governor¡¯s orders,¡± said he, ¡°conduct the prisoner to the tier
beneath.¡±

¡°To the dungeon, then,¡± said the corporal.

¡°Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.¡± The soldiers seized
Dant¨¨s, who followed passively.

He descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and he
was thrust in. The door closed, and Dant¨¨s advanced with outstretched
hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the corner until
his eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was right; Dant¨¨s
wanted but little of being utterly mad.






Chapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal

Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s
in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the
guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. Ren¨¦e
was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his
entrance was followed by a general exclamation.

¡°Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is the
matter?¡± said one. ¡°Speak out.¡±

¡°Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?¡± asked another.

¡°Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?¡± cried a third.

¡°Marquise,¡± said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, ¡°I
request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by a
few moments¡¯ private conversation?¡±

¡°Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?¡± asked the marquis, remarking
the cloud on Villefort¡¯s brow.

¡°So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,¡± added he,
turning to Ren¨¦e, ¡°judge for yourself if it be not important.¡±

¡°You are going to leave us?¡± cried Ren¨¦e, unable to hide her emotion at
this unexpected announcement.

¡°Alas,¡± returned Villefort, ¡°I must!¡±

¡°Where, then, are you going?¡± asked the marquise.

¡°That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions
for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with
pleasure undertake them.¡± The guests looked at each other.

¡°You wish to speak to me alone?¡± said the marquis.

¡°Yes, let us go to the library, please.¡± The marquis took his arm, and
they left the salon.

¡°Well,¡± asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, ¡°tell me what it
is?¡±

¡°An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate
presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you
any landed property?¡±

¡°All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand
francs.¡±

¡°Then sell out¡ªsell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.¡±

0123m


¡°But how can I sell out here?¡±

¡°You have a broker, have you not?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an
instant¡¯s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.¡±

¡°The deuce you say!¡± replied the marquis, ¡°let us lose no time, then!¡±

And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell
out at the market price.

¡°Now, then,¡± said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, ¡°I
must have another!¡±

¡°To whom?¡±

¡°To the king.¡±

¡°To the king?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I dare not write to his majesty.¡±

¡°I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do
so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king¡¯s presence
without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would
occasion a loss of precious time.¡±

¡°But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of
entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the
day or night.¡±

¡°Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my
discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and
take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made
if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget
the service I do him.¡±

¡°In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write
the letter.¡±

¡°Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an
hour.¡±

¡°Tell your coachman to stop at the door.¡±

¡°You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Ren¨¦e,
whom I leave on such a day with great regret.¡±

¡°You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.¡±

¡°A thousand thanks¡ªand now for the letter.¡±

The marquis rang, a servant entered.

¡°Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.¡±

¡°Now, then, go,¡± said the marquis.

¡°I shall be gone only a few moments.¡±

Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight
of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to
throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At
his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for
him. It was Merc¨¦d¨¨s, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come
unobserved to inquire after him.

As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dant¨¨s had
spoken of Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty
and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of
her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.

¡°The young man you speak of,¡± said Villefort abruptly, ¡°is a great
criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.¡± Merc¨¦d¨¨s burst
into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.

¡°But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive
or dead,¡± said she.

0125m


¡°I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,¡± replied Villefort.

And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and
closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not
thus banished; like Virgil¡¯s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his
wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was
almost a sob, and sank into a chair.

Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The
man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the
altar of his father¡¯s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,
leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,
not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow
and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to
the very moment of death. Then he had a moment¡¯s hesitation. He had
frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his
irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest
shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort¡¯s brow, because they were
guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose
happiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the
executioner.

As he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which
had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with
vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles
instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be
healed, but Villefort¡¯s was one of those that never close, or if they
do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the
sweet voice of Ren¨¦e had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the
fair Merc¨¦d¨¨s had entered and said, ¡°In the name of God, I conjure you
to restore me my affianced husband,¡± his cold and trembling hands would
have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the
chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort¡¯s valet, who came to
tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.

Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of
the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his
pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,
muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his
servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the
carriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s. The
hapless Dant¨¨s was doomed.

As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Ren¨¦e in
waiting. He started when he saw Ren¨¦e, for he fancied she was again
about to plead for Dant¨¨s. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she
was thinking only of Villefort¡¯s departure.

She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to
become her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Ren¨¦e,
far from pleading for Dant¨¨s, hated the man whose crime separated her
from her lover.

0127m


Meanwhile what of Merc¨¦d¨¨s? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue
de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast
herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and
covered it with kisses that Merc¨¦d¨¨s did not even feel. She passed the
night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to
the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had
made her blind to all but one object¡ªthat was Edmond.

¡°Ah, you are there,¡± said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.

¡°I have not quitted you since yesterday,¡± returned Fernand sorrowfully.

M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dant¨¨s
had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the
influential persons of the city; but the report was already in
circulation that Dant¨¨s was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the
most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne
as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in
despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more
could be done.

Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like
M. Morrel, to aid Dant¨¨s, he had shut himself up with two bottles of
black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not
succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not
so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the
table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the
light of the unsnuffed candle¡ªspectres such as Hoffmann strews over his
punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.

Danglars alone was content and joyous¡ªhe had got rid of an enemy and
made his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those
men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart.
Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man
was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking
it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires. He went to
bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.

Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieux¡¯s letter, embraced
Ren¨¦e, kissed the marquise¡¯s hand, and shaken that of the marquis,
started for Paris along the Aix road.

Old Dant¨¨s was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But
we know very well what had become of Edmond.






Chapter 10. The King¡¯s Closet at the Tuileries

We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling¡ªthanks to
trebled fees¡ªwith all speed, and passing through two or three
apartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched
window, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and
Louis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.

There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from
Hartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great
people, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was
carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with
gray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire, and
meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius¡¯s rather
inaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace¡ªa work which was
much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical
monarch.

¡°You say, sir¡ª¡ª¡± said the king.

¡°That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.¡±

¡°Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean
kine?¡±

¡°No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and
seven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your
majesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.¡±

¡°Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?¡±

¡°Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the
south.¡±

¡°Well, my dear duke,¡± replied Louis XVIII., ¡°I think you are wrongly
informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine
weather in that direction.¡± Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII. liked
a pleasant jest.

¡°Sire,¡± continued M. de Blacas, ¡°if it only be to reassure a faithful
servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphin¨¦,
trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling
in these three provinces?¡±

¡°Canimus surdis,¡± replied the king, continuing the annotations in his
Horace.

¡°Sire,¡± replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem to
comprehend the quotation, ¡°your majesty may be perfectly right in
relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether
wrong in dreading some desperate attempt.¡±

¡°By whom?¡±

¡°By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.¡±

¡°My dear Blacas,¡± said the king, ¡°you with your alarms prevent me from
working.¡±

¡°And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.¡±

¡°Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on
the Pastor quum traheret¡ªwait, and I will listen to you afterwards.¡±

There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as
small as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then
looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of
his own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said:

¡°Go on, my dear duke, go on¡ªI listen.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing
Villefort to his own profit, ¡°I am compelled to tell you that these are
not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a
serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to
watch over the south¡± (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words),
¡°has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king,
and so I hastened to you, sire.¡±

¡°Mala ducis avi domum,¡± continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.

¡°Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?¡±

¡°By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.¡±

¡°Which?¡±

¡°Whichever you please¡ªthere to the left.¡±

¡°Here, sire?¡±

¡°I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my
left¡ªyes, there. You will find yesterday¡¯s report of the minister of
police. But here is M. Dandr¨¦ himself;¡± and M. Dandr¨¦, announced by the
chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.

¡°Come in,¡± said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, ¡°come in, Baron, and
tell the duke all you know¡ªthe latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not
conceal anything, however serious,¡ªlet us see, the Island of Elba is a
volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling
war¡ªbella, horrida bella.¡±

M. Dandr¨¦ leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two
hands, and said:

¡°Has your majesty perused yesterday¡¯s report?¡±

¡°Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the
report contains¡ªgive him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in
his islet.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± said the baron to the duke, ¡°all the servants of his majesty
must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island of
Elba. Bonaparte¡ª¡ª¡±

M. Dandr¨¦ looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did
not even raise his head. ¡°Bonaparte,¡± continued the baron, ¡°is mortally
wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at Porto-
Longone.¡±

¡°And scratches himself for amusement,¡± added the king.

¡°Scratches himself?¡± inquired the duke, ¡°what does your majesty mean?¡±

¡°Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this
hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries
him to death, prurigo?¡±

¡°And, moreover, my dear duke,¡± continued the minister of police, ¡°we are
almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane.¡±

¡°Insane?¡±

¡°Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,
sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the
seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ¡®duck-
and-drake¡¯ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had
gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are
indubitable symptoms of insanity.¡±

¡°Or of wisdom, my dear baron¡ªor of wisdom,¡± said Louis XVIII., laughing;
¡°the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles
into the ocean¡ªsee Plutarch¡¯s life of Scipio Africanus.¡±

M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the
truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole
secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had
yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.

¡°Well, well, Dandr¨¦,¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°Blacas is not yet convinced;
let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper¡¯s conversion.¡± The minister of
police bowed.

¡°The usurper¡¯s conversion!¡± murmured the duke, looking at the king and
Dandr¨¦, who spoke alternately, like Virgil¡¯s shepherds. ¡°The usurper
converted!¡±

¡°Decidedly, my dear duke.¡±

¡°In what way converted?¡±

¡°To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.¡±

¡°Why, this is the way of it,¡± said the minister, with the gravest air in
the world: ¡°Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his old
veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their
dismissal, and exhorted them to ¡®serve the good king.¡¯ These were his
own words, of that I am certain.¡±

¡°Well, Blacas, what think you of this?¡± inquired the king triumphantly,
and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.

¡°I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am;
and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the
guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable
that I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will
interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your
majesty to do him this honor.¡±

¡°Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person you
please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have you
any report more recent than this, dated the 20th February, and this is
the 3rd of March?¡±

¡°No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I
left my office.¡±

¡°Go thither, and if there be none¡ªwell, well,¡± continued Louis XVIII.,
¡°make one; that is the usual way, is it not?¡± and the king laughed
facetiously.

¡°Oh, sire,¡± replied the minister, ¡°we have no occasion to invent any;
every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations,
coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which
they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon
some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.¡±

¡°Well, sir, go¡±; said Louis XVIII., ¡°and remember that I am waiting for
you.¡±

¡°I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.¡±

¡°And I, sire,¡± said M. de Blacas, ¡°will go and find my messenger.¡±

¡°Wait, sir, wait,¡± said Louis XVIII. ¡°Really, M. de Blacas, I must
change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with
outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to
escape, and bearing this device¡ªTenax.¡±

0133m


¡°Sire, I listen,¡± said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.

¡°I wish to consult you on this passage, ¡®Molli fugiens anhelitu,¡¯ you
know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are you not a sportsman and
a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the molli
anhelitu?¡±

¡°Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he
has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.¡±

¡°Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we
have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and
that without getting in the least out of breath.¡±

¡°Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so
far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information. If
only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat
your majesty to receive him graciously.¡±

¡°M. de Salvieux, my brother¡¯s chamberlain?¡±

¡°Yes, sire.¡±

¡°He is at Marseilles.¡±

¡°And writes me thence.¡±

¡°Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?¡±

¡°No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him
to your majesty.¡±

¡°M. de Villefort!¡± cried the king, ¡°is the messenger¡¯s name M. de
Villefort?¡±

¡°Yes, sire.¡±

¡°And he comes from Marseilles?¡±

¡°In person.¡±

¡°Why did you not mention his name at once?¡± replied the king, betraying
some uneasiness.

¡°Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.¡±

¡°No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
ambitious, too, and, pardieu! you know his father¡¯s name!¡±

¡°His father?¡±

¡°Yes, Noirtier.¡±

¡°Noirtier the Girondin?¡ªNoirtier the senator?¡±

¡°He himself.¡±

¡°And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?¡±

¡°Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you
Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would
sacrifice everything, even his father.¡±

¡°Then, sire, may I present him?¡±

¡°This instant, duke! Where is he?¡±

¡°Waiting below, in my carriage.¡±

¡°Seek him at once.¡±

¡°I hasten to do so.¡±

The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his
really sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis XVIII. remained
alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:

¡°Justum et tenacem propositi virum.¡±

M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king¡¯s authority. Villefort¡¯s
dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the
susceptibility of M. de Brez¨¦, who was all astonishment at finding that
this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire.
The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word¡ªhis majesty¡¯s
order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies
made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort was
introduced.

The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On
opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young
magistrate¡¯s first impulse was to pause.

¡°Come in, M. de Villefort,¡± said the king, ¡°come in.¡±

Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should
interrogate him.

¡°M. de Villefort,¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°the Duc de Blacas assures me you
have some interesting information to communicate.¡±

¡°Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it
equally important.¡±

0137m


¡°In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad
in your opinion as I am asked to believe?¡±

¡°Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have
used, that it is not irreparable.¡±

¡°Speak as fully as you please, sir,¡± said the king, who began to give
way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas¡¯s face and affected
Villefort¡¯s voice. ¡°Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like
order in everything.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± said Villefort, ¡°I will render a faithful report to your
majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some
obscurity in my language.¡± A glance at the king after this discreet and
subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august
auditor, and he went on:

¡°Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your
majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a
commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the
lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy¡ªa
storm which menaces no less than your majesty¡¯s throne. Sire, the
usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however
mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba,
to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at
Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has
maintained his relations with Italy and France?¡±

¡°I am, sir,¡± said the king, much agitated; ¡°and recently we have had
information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue
Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these
details?¡±

¡°Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man
of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the
day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and
whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of
Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral
message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from
him; but this mission was to prepare men¡¯s minds for a return (it is the
man who says this, sire)¡ªa return which will soon occur.¡±

¡°And where is this man?¡±

¡°In prison, sire.¡±

¡°And the matter seems serious to you?¡±

¡°So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst
of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride
and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your
majesty¡¯s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my
devotion.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°was there not a marriage engagement between
you and Mademoiselle de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡±

¡°Daughter of one of your majesty¡¯s most faithful servants.¡±

¡°Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.¡±

¡°Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.¡±

¡°A conspiracy in these times,¡± said Louis XVIII., smiling, ¡°is a thing
very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch
as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have
our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. For
the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in
order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte landed at
Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach
Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory;
if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result
of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. Take
courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.¡±

¡°Ah, here is M. Dandr¨¦!¡± cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister
of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to
faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his hand,
restrained him.






Chapter 11. The Corsican Ogre

At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently
the table at which he was sitting.

¡°What ails you, baron?¡± he exclaimed. ¡°You appear quite aghast. Has your
uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de
Villefort has just confirmed?¡± M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the
baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the
statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his
advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that
he should humiliate the prefect.

¡°Sire,¡ª¡ª¡± stammered the baron.

¡°Well, what is it?¡± asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving
way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of
Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.

¡°Will you speak?¡± he said.

¡°Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can
never forgive myself!¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°I command you to speak.¡±

¡°Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on
the 1st of March.¡±

¡°And where? In Italy?¡± asked the king eagerly.

¡°In France, sire,¡ªat a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.¡±

¡°The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two
hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only
acquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you
tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you
have gone mad.¡±

¡°Alas, sire, it is but too true!¡± Louis made a gesture of indescribable
anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had
struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.

¡°In France!¡± he cried, ¡°the usurper in France! Then they did not watch
over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.¡±

¡°Oh, sire,¡± exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, ¡°M. Dandr¨¦ is not a man to be
accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of
police has shared the general blindness, that is all.¡±

¡°But¡ª¡ª¡± said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was
silent; then he continued, ¡°Your pardon, sire,¡± he said, bowing, ¡°my
zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?¡±

¡°Speak, sir, speak boldly,¡± replied Louis. ¡°You alone forewarned us of
the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± said Villefort, ¡°the usurper is detested in the south; and it
seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to
raise Languedoc and Provence against him.¡±

¡°Yes, assuredly,¡± replied the minister; ¡°but he is advancing by Gap and
Sisteron.¡±

¡°Advancing¡ªhe is advancing!¡± said Louis XVIII. ¡°Is he then advancing on
Paris?¡± The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent
to a complete avowal.

¡°And Dauphin¨¦, sir?¡± inquired the king, of Villefort. ¡°Do you think it
possible to rouse that as well as Provence?¡±

¡°Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in
Dauphin¨¦ is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The
mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.¡±

¡°Then,¡± murmured Louis, ¡°he was well informed. And how many men had he
with him?¡±

¡°I do not know, sire,¡± answered the minister of police.

¡°What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that
point? Of course it is of no consequence,¡± he added, with a withering
smile.

¡°Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact
of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.¡±

¡°And how did this despatch reach you?¡± inquired the king. The minister
bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he
stammered out:

¡°By the telegraph, sire.¡± Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his
arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.

0141m


¡°So then,¡± he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, ¡°seven conjoined and
allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on the
throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have,
during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the
people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now,
when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I
hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!¡±

¡°Sire, it is fatality!¡± murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure
of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any
human strength to endure.

¡°What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,
forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself;
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor,
who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,¡ªfor my
fortune is theirs¡ªbefore me they were nothing¡ªafter me they will be
nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity¡ªineptitude! Oh, yes, sir,
you are right¡ªit is fatality!¡±

The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped
the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt
his increased importance.

¡°To fall,¡± continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the
abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,¡ª¡°to fall, and learn of that
fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother,
Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away
by ridicule. Ridicule, sir¡ªwhy, you know not its power in France, and
yet you ought to know it!¡±

¡°Sire, sire,¡± murmured the minister, ¡°for pity¡¯s¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Approach, M. de Villefort,¡± resumed the king, addressing the young man,
who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which
depended the destiny of a kingdom. ¡°Approach, and tell monsieur that it
is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.¡±

¡°Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man
concealed from all the world.¡±

¡°Really impossible! Yes¡ªthat is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there
are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really
impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen
hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going
on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a
gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal¡ªa gentleman,
only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your
police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the
power of directing a telegraph.¡± The look of the minister of police was
turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest
triumph.

¡°I do not mean that for you, Blacas,¡± continued Louis XVIII.; ¡°for if
you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to
persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have
considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else
dictated by venal ambition.¡± These words were an allusion to the
sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much
confidence an hour before.

Villefort understood the king¡¯s intent. Any other person would, perhaps,
have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he
feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister,
although he saw that Dandr¨¦ was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister,
who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth
Napoleon¡¯s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate
Dant¨¨s and so lay bare the motives of Villefort¡¯s plot. Realizing this,
Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of
aiding to crush him.

¡°Sire,¡± said Villefort, ¡°the suddenness of this event must prove to your
majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty
is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing
to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted
servant¡ªthat¡¯s all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire,
that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion
you have been pleased to form of me.¡± The minister of police thanked the
young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had
succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the
gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of
necessity, he might rely.

¡°¡¯Tis well,¡± resumed the king. ¡°And now, gentlemen,¡± he continued,
turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, ¡°I have no
further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is
in the department of the minister of war.¡±

¡°Fortunately, sire,¡± said M. de Blacas, ¡°we can rely on the army; your
majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.¡±

¡°Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to
place in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned
with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?¡±

¡°The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!¡± exclaimed Villefort, unable to
repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, ¡°Your pardon,
sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the
respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the
rules of etiquette.¡±

¡°Go on, go on, sir,¡± replied the king; ¡°you have today earned the right
to make inquiries here.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± interposed the minister of police, ¡°I came a moment ago to give
your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when
your majesty¡¯s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has
occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your
majesty.¡±

¡°On the contrary, sir,¡ªon the contrary,¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°this affair
seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our
attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the
direct track of a great internal conspiracy.¡± At the name of General
Quesnel, Villefort trembled.

¡°Everything points to the conclusion, sire,¡± said the minister of
police, ¡°that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed,
but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a
Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with
him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-
Jacques; unfortunately, the general¡¯s valet, who was dressing his hair
at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but
did not catch the number.¡± As the police minister related this to the
king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker¡¯s
lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him.

¡°Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom
they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely
devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?¡±

¡°It is probable, sire,¡± replied Villefort. ¡°But is this all that is
known?¡±

¡°They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.¡±

¡°On his track?¡± said Villefort.

¡°Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty
to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy
eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an
officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding
with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the
corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-H¨¦ron.¡± Villefort
leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on
speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the
unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he
breathed again.

¡°Continue to seek for this man, sir,¡± said the king to the minister of
police; ¡°for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would
have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his
assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.¡± It required
all Villefort¡¯s coolness not to betray the terror with which this
declaration of the king inspired him.

¡°How strange,¡± continued the king, with some asperity; ¡°the police think
that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ¡®A murder has
been committed,¡¯ and especially so when they can add, ¡®And we are on the
track of the guilty persons.¡¯¡±

¡°Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at
least.¡±

¡°We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you
must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you
stopped at your father¡¯s?¡± A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.

0145m


¡°No, sire,¡± he replied, ¡°I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue
de Tournon.¡±

¡°But you have seen him?¡±

¡°Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.¡±

¡°But you will see him, then?¡±

¡°I think not, sire.¡±

¡°Ah, I forgot,¡± said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all
these questions were not made without a motive; ¡°I forgot you and M.
Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another
sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be
recompensed.¡±

¡°Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a
recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing
more to ask for.¡±

¡°Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the
meanwhile¡± (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor
which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,
above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave it
to Villefort)¡ª¡°in the meanwhile take this cross.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± said Villefort, ¡°your majesty mistakes; this is an officer¡¯s
cross.¡±

¡°Ma foi!¡± said Louis XVIII., ¡°take it, such as it is, for I have not the
time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see that the
brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.¡± Villefort¡¯s eyes were
filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.

¡°And now,¡± he said, ¡°may I inquire what are the orders with which your
majesty deigns to honor me?¡±

¡°Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to
serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at
Marseilles.¡±

¡°Sire,¡± replied Villefort, bowing, ¡°in an hour I shall have quitted
Paris.¡±

¡°Go, sir,¡± said the king; ¡°and should I forget you (kings¡¯ memories are
short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron,
send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.¡±

¡°Ah, sir,¡± said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the
Tuileries, ¡°you entered by luck¡¯s door¡ªyour fortune is made.¡±

¡°Will it be long first?¡± muttered Villefort, saluting the minister,
whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach. One
passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the
driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to
dreams of ambition.

Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be
ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him. He
was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and
loud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard someone speak his
name.

0147m


¡°Who could know that I was here already?¡± said the young man. The valet
entered.

¡°Well,¡± said Villefort, ¡°what is it?¡ªWho rang?¡ªWho asked for me?¡±

¡°A stranger who will not send in his name.¡±

¡°A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?¡±

¡°He wishes to speak to you.¡±

¡°To me?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Did he mention my name?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°What sort of person is he?¡±

¡°Why, sir, a man of about fifty.¡±

¡°Short or tall?¡±

¡°About your own height, sir.¡±

¡°Dark or fair?¡±

¡°Dark,¡ªvery dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.¡±

¡°And how dressed?¡± asked Villefort quickly.

¡°In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of
Honor.¡±

¡°It is he!¡± said Villefort, turning pale.

0148m


¡°Eh, pardieu!¡± said the individual whose description we have twice
given, entering the door, ¡°what a great deal of ceremony! Is it the
custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their
anterooms?¡±

¡°Father!¡± cried Villefort, ¡°then I was not deceived; I felt sure it must
be you.¡±

¡°Well, then, if you felt so sure,¡± replied the new-comer, putting his
cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, ¡°allow me to say, my dear
G¨¦rard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the
door.¡±

¡°Leave us, Germain,¡± said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment
with evident signs of astonishment.






Chapter 12. Father and Son

M. Noirtier¡ªfor it was, indeed, he who entered¡ªlooked after the servant
until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might be
overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the
precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who
proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first
parents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the
antechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his
hand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which
he could not conceal.

¡°Well, now, my dear G¨¦rard,¡± said he to the young man, with a very
significant look, ¡°do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad to
see me?¡±

¡°My dear father,¡± said Villefort, ¡°I am, on the contrary, delighted; but
I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.¡±

¡°But, my dear fellow,¡± replied M. Noirtier, seating himself, ¡°I might
say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the
28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris.¡±

¡°And if I have come, my dear father,¡± said G¨¦rard, drawing closer to M.
Noirtier, ¡°do not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my
journey will be your salvation.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed!¡± said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease in
the chair. ¡°Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must be
interesting.¡±

¡°Father, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue
Saint-Jacques?¡±

¡°No. 53; yes, I am vice-president.¡±

¡°Father, your coolness makes me shudder.¡±

¡°Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers,
has escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of
Bordeaux by Robespierre¡¯s bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most
things. But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?¡±

¡°Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel, who
quitted his own house at nine o¡¯clock in the evening, was found the next
day in the Seine.¡±

0151m


¡°And who told you this fine story?¡±

¡°The king himself.¡±

¡°Well, then, in return for your story,¡± continued Noirtier, ¡°I will tell
you another.¡±

¡°My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.¡±

¡°Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?¡±

¡°Not so loud, father, I entreat of you¡ªfor your own sake as well as
mine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for
three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible
speed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.¡±

¡°Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not
landed.¡±

¡°No matter, I was aware of his intention.¡±

¡°How did you know about it?¡±

¡°By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.¡±

¡°To me?¡±

¡°To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger. Had
that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father, would
probably ere this have been shot.¡± Villefort¡¯s father laughed.

¡°Come, come,¡± said he, ¡°will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so
promptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you speak
of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass
you.¡±

¡°I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that
letter must have led to your condemnation.¡±

¡°And the destruction of your future prospects,¡± replied Noirtier; ¡°yes,
I can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to fear while I have
you to protect me.¡±

¡°I do better than that, sir¡ªI save you.¡±

¡°You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic¡ªexplain
yourself.¡±

¡°I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.¡±

¡°It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn¡¯t
they search more vigilantly? they would have found¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°They have not found; but they are on the track.¡±

¡°Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the
police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the
government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a
sneaking air, that the track is lost.¡±

¡°Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in
all countries they call that a murder.¡±

¡°A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the
general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having
thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to
swim.¡±

¡°Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown
himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of
January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of
the word.¡±

¡°And who thus designated it?¡±

¡°The king himself.¡±

¡°The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was
no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well as
I do, there are no men, but ideas¡ªno feelings, but interests; in
politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.
Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell
you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was
recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and
invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.
He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the
projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the
fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at
each other,¡ªhe was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an
ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and yet,
in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free¡ªperfectly free.
Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear fellow,
that on leaving us he lost his way, that¡¯s all. A murder? really,
Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found an
accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were
fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of
my party, ¡®My son, you have committed a murder?¡¯ No, I said, ¡®Very well,
sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it will be our
turn.¡¯¡±

¡°But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be
sweeping.¡±

¡°I do not understand you.¡±

¡°You rely on the usurper¡¯s return?¡±

¡°We do.¡±

¡°You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of
France without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.¡±

¡°My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;
on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at
Paris.¡±

¡°The people will rise.¡±

¡°Yes, to go and meet him.¡±

¡°He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched
against him.¡±

¡°Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear G¨¦rard, you are
but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has
told you, three days after the landing, ¡®The usurper has landed at
Cannes with several men. He is pursued.¡¯ But where is he? what is he
doing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to
Paris, without drawing a trigger.¡±

¡°Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an
impassable barrier.¡±

¡°Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm¡ªall Lyons will
hasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and
our police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,
you wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your
arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your
direction to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in
proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,
then, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will
dine together.¡±

¡°Indeed!¡± replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,
¡°you really do seem very well informed.¡±

¡°Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the
means that money produces¡ªwe who are in expectation, have those which
devotion prompts.¡±

¡°Devotion!¡± said Villefort, with a sneer.

¡°Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful
ambition.¡±

And Villefort¡¯s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon the
servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.

¡°Wait, my dear father,¡± said the young man, ¡°one word more.¡±

¡°Say on.¡±

¡°However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible
thing.¡±

¡°What is that?¡±

¡°The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General
Quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.¡±

¡°Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may
be that description?¡±

¡°Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in
his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.¡±

¡°Ah, ha, that¡¯s it, is it?¡± said Noirtier; ¡°and why, then, have they not
laid hands on him?¡±

¡°Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the
corner of the Rue Coq-H¨¦ron.¡±

¡°Didn¡¯t I say that your police were good for nothing?¡±

¡°Yes; but they may catch him yet.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, ¡°true, if this
person were not on his guard, as he is;¡± and he added with a smile, ¡°He
will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.¡± At
these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went towards
a table on which lay his son¡¯s toilet articles, lathered his face, took
a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising whiskers.
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.

His whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,
instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top
of an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned
frock-coat, a coat of Villefort¡¯s of dark brown, and cut away in front;
tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son¡¯s, which
appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner where
he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air with
it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger which was one
of his principal characteristics.

¡°Well,¡± he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise
was completed, ¡°well, do you think your police will recognize me now.¡±

¡°No, father,¡± stammered Villefort; ¡°at least, I hope not.¡±

¡°And now, my dear boy,¡± continued Noirtier, ¡°I rely on your prudence to
remove all the things which I leave in your care.¡±

¡°Oh, rely on me,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really
saved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.¡±

Villefort shook his head.

¡°You are not convinced yet?¡±

¡°I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.¡±

¡°Shall you see the king again?¡±

¡°Perhaps.¡±

¡°Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?¡±

¡°Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.¡±

¡°True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second
restoration, you would then pass for a great man.¡±

¡°Well, what should I say to the king?¡±

¡°Say this to him: ¡®Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,
as to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he whom
in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled the
usurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at
Grenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing as
rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with
hunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of
snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave France
to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but by
right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your
adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be
humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of
Arcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.¡¯ Tell him this, G¨¦rard; or, rather, tell
him nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have
come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter
Marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,
quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I
swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies. Go,
my son¡ªgo, my dear G¨¦rard, and by your obedience to my paternal orders,
or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in your place.
This will be,¡± added Noirtier, with a smile, ¡°one means by which you may
a second time save me, if the political balance should some day take
another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down. Adieu, my dear
G¨¦rard, and at your next journey alight at my door.¡±

Noirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness that
had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying
conversation. Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside
the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-
looking men at the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to
arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with
broad brim.

Villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared
at the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left
behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of
the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into
small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and
calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was
ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,
learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst
of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached
Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart
of man with ambition and its first successes.






Chapter 13. The Hundred Days

M. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had
predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a
return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain
without a counterpart in the future.

Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the
monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of
ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,
therefore, gained nothing save the king¡¯s gratitude (which was rather
likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of
Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had
duly forwarded the brevet.

Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it
not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
Girondin of ¡¯93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had
been his protector. All Villefort¡¯s influence barely enabled him to
stifle the secret Dant¨¨s had so nearly divulged. The king¡¯s procureur
alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.

However, scarcely was the imperial power established¡ªthat is, scarcely
had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from
the closet into which we have introduced our readers,¡ªhe found on the
table there Louis XVIII.¡¯s half-filled snuff-box,¡ªscarcely had this
occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle
the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it
required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater
violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the
royalists whenever they ventured abroad.

Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment¡ªwe will
not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid
man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte
accused him of ¡°moderation¡±¡ªbut sufficiently influential to make a
demand in favor of Dant¨¨s.

Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more
favorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, G¨¦rard
required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.
returned, the influence of M. de Saint-M¨¦ran, like his own, could be
vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy
procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one
morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.

Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man
of ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made Morrel
wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for the simple
reason that the king¡¯s procureur always makes everyone wait, and after
passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M. Morrel
to be admitted.

Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had
found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial
politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-
bred from the vulgar man.

He had entered Villefort¡¯s office expecting that the magistrate would
tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all
over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk,
and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door; Villefort
gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then,
after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat
in his hands,

¡°M. Morrel, I believe?¡± said Villefort.

¡°Yes, sir.¡±

¡°Come nearer,¡± said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the hand,
¡°and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.¡±

¡°Do you not guess, monsieur?¡± asked Morrel.

¡°Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be
delighted.¡±

¡°Everything depends on you.¡±

¡°Explain yourself, pray.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, ¡°do
you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the
emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who
was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of
Elba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor. You then
served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor¡ªit was your duty;
today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him¡ªit is equally
your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?¡±

0161m


Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. ¡°What is his
name?¡± said he. ¡°Tell me his name.¡±

¡°Edmond Dant¨¨s.¡±

Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a
pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he
did not blanch.

¡°Dant¨¨s,¡± repeated he, ¡°Edmond Dant¨¨s.¡±

¡°Yes, monsieur.¡± Villefort opened a large register, then went to a
table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to
Morrel,

¡°Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?¡± said he, in the
most natural tone in the world.

Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these
matters, he would have been surprised at the king¡¯s procureur answering
him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the
prison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in his
expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other¡¯s
condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.

¡°No,¡± said Morrel; ¡°I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,
the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I
came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to plead
for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were very
severe with the Bonapartists in those days.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± returned Villefort, ¡°I was then a royalist, because I
believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen
of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the
legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.¡±

¡°That¡¯s right!¡± cried Morrel. ¡°I like to hear you speak thus, and I
augur well for Edmond from it.¡±

¡°Wait a moment,¡± said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;
¡°I have it¡ªa sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I
recollect now; it was a very serious charge.¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was
carried off.¡±

¡°Carried off!¡± said Morrel. ¡°What can they have done with him?¡±

¡°Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the Sainte-
Margu¨¦rite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take command of
your vessel.¡±

¡°Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not
already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be
to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.¡±

¡°Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,¡± replied Villefort. ¡°The order of
imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation
must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been
reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Morrel, ¡°is there no way of expediting all these
formalities¡ªof releasing him from arrest?¡±

¡°There has been no arrest.¡±

¡°How?¡±

¡°It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man¡¯s disappearance
without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may
defeat their wishes.¡±

¡°It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself,
and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is
incalculable.¡± Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would
have dispelled them.

¡°Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?¡± asked he.

¡°Petition the minister.¡±

¡°Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions
every day, and does not read three.¡±

¡°That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented
by me.¡±

¡°And will you undertake to deliver it?¡±

¡°With the greatest pleasure. Dant¨¨s was then guilty, and now he is
innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn
him.¡± Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,
however improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him
defenceless.

¡°But how shall I address the minister?¡±

¡°Sit down there,¡± said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, ¡°and
write what I dictate.¡±

¡°Will you be so good?¡±

¡°Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.¡±

¡°That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be
suffering.¡±

Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw
back. Dant¨¨s must be crushed to gratify Villefort¡¯s ambition.

Villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no
doubt, Dant¨¨s¡¯ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made out
one of the most active agents of Napoleon¡¯s return. It was evident that
at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him.
The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.

¡°That will do,¡± said he; ¡°leave the rest to me.¡±

¡°Will the petition go soon?¡±

¡°Today.¡±

¡°Countersigned by you?¡±

¡°The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of
your petition.¡± And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate at
the bottom.

¡°What more is to be done?¡±

¡°I will do whatever is necessary.¡± This assurance delighted Morrel, who
took leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dant¨¨s that he
would soon see his son.

As for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved
the petition that so fearfully compromised Dant¨¨s, in the hopes of an
event that seemed not unlikely,¡ªthat is, a second restoration. Dant¨¨s
remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis
XVIII.¡¯s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.

Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice
had Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo, and
Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any
fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.

Louis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had
become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the
situation of king¡¯s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards he
married Mademoiselle de Saint-M¨¦ran, whose father now stood higher at
court than ever.

And so Dant¨¨s, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in
his dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.

Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that
overwhelmed Dant¨¨s; and, when Napoleon returned to France, he, after the
manner of mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, a decree of
Providence. But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars¡¯ heart failed
him, and he lived in constant fear of Dant¨¨s¡¯ return on a mission of
vengeance. He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to quit the sea,
and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish merchant, into whose
service he entered at the end of March, that is, ten or twelve days
after Napoleon¡¯s return. He then left for Madrid, and was no more heard
of.

Fernand understood nothing except that Dant¨¨s was absent. What had
become of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the
absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of
deceiving Merc¨¦d¨¨s as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of
emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless
on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the
Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and
handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance. Fernand¡¯s
mind was made up; he would shoot Dant¨¨s, and then kill himself. But
Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for
he constantly hopes.

During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in
France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the
emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible
thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry
Merc¨¦d¨¨s. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done
so when he parted from Merc¨¦d¨¨s. His devotion, and the compassion he
showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on
noble minds¡ªMerc¨¦d¨¨s had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and
this was now strengthened by gratitude.

¡°My brother,¡± said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders, ¡°be
careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the
world.¡± These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand¡¯s heart. Should
Dant¨¨s not return, Merc¨¦d¨¨s might one day be his.

0165m


Merc¨¦d¨¨s was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never
seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in
tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute
and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times
gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast
herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not
want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into
execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.

Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married
and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dant¨¨s,
who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon¡¯s downfall.
Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the
hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡¯ arms. M. Morrel
paid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man
had contracted.

There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the
south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so
dangerous a Bonapartist as Dant¨¨s, was stigmatized as a crime.






Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners

A year after Louis XVIII.¡¯s restoration, a visit was made by the
inspector-general of prisons. Dant¨¨s in his cell heard the noise of
preparation,¡ªsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been
inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of
the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He
guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so
long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon
himself as dead.

The inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of
several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended
them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,
and if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that
the fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.

The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook
their heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector
turned smilingly to the governor.

¡°I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless
visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,¡ªalways the same
thing,¡ªill fed and innocent. Are there any others?¡±

¡°Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.¡±

¡°Let us visit them,¡± said the inspector with an air of fatigue. ¡°We must
play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.¡±

¡°Let us first send for two soldiers,¡± said the governor. ¡°The prisoners
sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be sentenced
to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall a victim.¡±

¡°Take all needful precautions,¡± replied the inspector.

Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a
stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,
smell, and respiration.

¡°Oh,¡± cried the inspector, ¡°who can live here?¡±

¡°A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most
strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.¡±

¡°He is alone?¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

¡°How long has he been there?¡±

¡°Nearly a year.¡±

¡°Was he placed here when he first arrived?¡±

¡°No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to
him.¡±

¡°To kill the turnkey?¡±

¡°Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?¡± asked
the governor.

¡°True enough; he wanted to kill me!¡± returned the turnkey.

¡°He must be mad,¡± said the inspector.

¡°He is worse than that,¡ªhe is a devil!¡± returned the turnkey.

¡°Shall I complain of him?¡± demanded the inspector.

¡°Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another
year he will be quite so.¡±

¡°So much the better for him,¡ªhe will suffer less,¡± said the inspector.
He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every
way fit for his office.

¡°You are right, sir,¡± replied the governor; ¡°and this remark proves that
you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon about
twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair, an old
abb¨¦, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here since 1811,
and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He used to weep,
he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had better see him,
for his madness is amusing.¡±

¡°I will see them both,¡± returned the inspector; ¡°I must conscientiously
perform my duty.¡±

This was the inspector¡¯s first visit; he wished to display his
authority.

¡°Let us visit this one first,¡± added he.

¡°By all means,¡± replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to
open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the
creaking of the hinges, Dant¨¨s, who was crouched in a corner of the
dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow
iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two
turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom
the governor spoke bareheaded, Dant¨¨s, who guessed the truth, and that
the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come,
sprang forward with clasped hands.

The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was
about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three
steps. Dant¨¨s saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing
all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the
inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.

The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,
observed, ¡°He will become religious¡ªhe is already more gentle; he is
afraid, and retreated before the bayonets¡ªmadmen are not afraid of
anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.¡± Then,
turning to the prisoner, ¡°What is it you want?¡± said he.

¡°I want to know what crime I have committed¡ªto be tried; and if I am
guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.¡±

¡°Are you well fed?¡± said the inspector.

¡°I believe so; I don¡¯t know; it¡¯s of no consequence. What matters
really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that
an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous
denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.¡±

¡°You are very humble today,¡± remarked the governor; ¡°you are not so
always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the
turnkey.¡±

¡°It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very good
to me, but I was mad.¡±

¡°And you are not so any longer?¡±

¡°No; captivity has subdued me¡ªI have been here so long.¡±

¡°So long?¡ªwhen were you arrested, then?¡± asked the inspector.

¡°The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.¡±

¡°Today is the 30th of July, 1816,¡ªwhy, it is but seventeen months.¡±

¡°Only seventeen months,¡± replied Dant¨¨s. ¡°Oh, you do not know what is
seventeen months in prison!¡ªseventeen ages rather, especially to a man
who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition¡ªto a man, who,
like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an
honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant¡ªwho
sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his
affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen
months¡¯ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a
worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then,
and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a
verdict¡ªa trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be
denied to one who is accused!¡±

¡°We shall see,¡± said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, ¡°On
my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against
him.¡±

¡°Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± continued Dant¨¨s, ¡°I know it is not in your power to release
me; but you can plead for me¡ªyou can have me tried¡ªand that is all I
ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned.
Uncertainty is worse than all.¡±

¡°Go on with the lights,¡± said the inspector.

¡°Monsieur,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, ¡°I can tell by your voice you are touched with
pity; tell me at least to hope.¡±

¡°I cannot tell you that,¡± replied the inspector; ¡°I can only promise to
examine into your case.¡±

¡°Oh, I am free¡ªthen I am saved!¡±

¡°Who arrested you?¡±

¡°M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.¡±

¡°M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.¡±

¡°I am no longer surprised at my detention,¡± murmured Dant¨¨s, ¡°since my
only protector is removed.¡±

¡°Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?¡±

¡°None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.¡±

¡°I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?¡±

¡°Entirely.¡±

¡°That is well; wait patiently, then.¡±

Dant¨¨s fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but
this time a fresh inmate was left with Dant¨¨s¡ªHope.

0173m


¡°Will you see the register at once,¡± asked the governor, ¡°or proceed to
the other cell?¡±

¡°Let us visit them all,¡± said the inspector. ¡°If I once went up those
stairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.¡±

¡°Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting
than this one¡¯s display of reason.¡±

¡°What is his folly?¡±

¡°He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered
government a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the
third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of
captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five
millions.¡±

¡°How curious!¡ªwhat is his name?¡±

¡°The Abb¨¦ Faria.¡±

¡°No. 27,¡± said the inspector.

¡°It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.¡±

The turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber
of the mad abb¨¦, as the prisoner was usually called.

In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster
detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely
covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed
as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of
Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the door, and
continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up
with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his
head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present. He
hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.

¡°What is it you want?¡± said the inspector.

¡°I, monsieur,¡± replied the abb¨¦ with an air of surprise,¡ª¡°I want
nothing.¡±

¡°You do not understand,¡± continued the inspector; ¡°I am sent here by
government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.¡±

¡°Oh, that is different,¡± cried the abb¨¦; ¡°and we shall understand each
other, I hope.¡±

¡°There, now,¡± whispered the governor, ¡°it is just as I told you.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± continued the prisoner, ¡°I am the Abb¨¦ Faria, born at Rome.
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada¡¯s secretary; I was arrested, why,
I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have
demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.¡±

¡°Why from the French government?¡±

¡°Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and
Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the inspector, ¡°you have not the latest news from Italy?¡±

¡°My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,¡± returned
the Abb¨¦ Faria; ¡°and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for
his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli
and C?sar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± returned the inspector, ¡°Providence has changed this
gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.¡±

¡°It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and
independent.¡±

¡°Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire
if you have anything to ask or to complain of.¡±

¡°The food is the same as in other prisons,¡ªthat is, very bad; the
lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon;
but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to
reveal of the greatest importance.¡±

¡°We are coming to the point,¡± whispered the governor.

¡°It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,¡± continued the abb¨¦,
¡°although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which,
if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton¡¯s system. Could you allow
me a few words in private.¡±

¡°What did I tell you?¡± said the governor.

¡°You knew him,¡± returned the inspector with a smile.

¡°What you ask is impossible, monsieur,¡± continued he, addressing Faria.

0175m


¡°But,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to
five millions.¡±

¡°The very sum you named,¡± whispered the inspector in his turn.

¡°However,¡± continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to
depart, ¡°it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor
can be present.¡±

¡°Unfortunately,¡± said the governor, ¡°I know beforehand what you are
about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?¡± Faria fixed his
eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of
his sanity.

¡°Of course,¡± said he; ¡°of what else should I speak?¡±

¡°Mr. Inspector,¡± continued the governor, ¡°I can tell you the story as
well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five
years.¡±

¡°That proves,¡± returned the abb¨¦, ¡°that you are like those of Holy Writ,
who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.¡±

¡°My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,¡±
replied the inspector; ¡°keep them until you are liberated.¡± The abb¨¦¡¯s
eyes glistened; he seized the inspector¡¯s hand.

¡°But what if I am not liberated,¡± cried he, ¡°and am detained here until
my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit
by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the
rest, if they will only give me my liberty.¡±

¡°On my word,¡± said the inspector in a low tone, ¡°had I not been told
beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.¡±

¡°I am not mad,¡± replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar
to prisoners. ¡°The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to
sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot
where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,¡ªI ask no
more.¡±

The governor laughed. ¡°Is the spot far from here?¡±

¡°A hundred leagues.¡±

¡°It is not ill-planned,¡± said the governor. ¡°If all the prisoners took
it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians
consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of
escaping.¡±

¡°The scheme is well known,¡± said the inspector; ¡°and the abb¨¦¡¯s plan has
not even the merit of originality.¡±

Then turning to Faria, ¡°I inquired if you are well fed?¡± said he.

¡°Swear to me,¡± replied Faria, ¡°to free me if what I tell you prove true,
and I will stay here while you go to the spot.¡±

¡°Are you well fed?¡± repeated the inspector.

¡°Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so
there is no chance of my escaping.¡±

¡°You do not reply to my question,¡± replied the inspector impatiently.

¡°Nor you to mine,¡± cried the abb¨¦. ¡°You will not accept my gold; I will
keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.¡± And
the abb¨¦, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued
his calculations.

0177m


¡°What is he doing there?¡± said the inspector.

¡°Counting his treasures,¡± replied the governor.

Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They
went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.

¡°He was wealthy once, perhaps?¡± said the inspector.

¡°Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.¡±

¡°After all,¡± said the inspector, ¡°if he had been rich, he would not have
been here.¡±

So the matter ended for the Abb¨¦ Faria. He remained in his cell, and
this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.

Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the
impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his
wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern
times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither
courage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the
eye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves
sprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are
not inviolable.

It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer
the victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition rarely
allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their
flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell,
from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital,
where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being
the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the Abb¨¦ Faria, gone mad
in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.

The inspector kept his word with Dant¨¨s; he examined the register, and
found the following note concerning him:

Edmond Dant¨¨s:

Violent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.

The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.

This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it
had been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend
against this accusation; he simply wrote, Nothing to be done.

This visit had infused new vigor into Dant¨¨s; he had, till then,
forgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the
date, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose
his reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months¡ªDant¨¨s
still waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This
fortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until
his return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his circuit
was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months passed away,
then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no
favorable change had taken place, and Dant¨¨s began to fancy the
inspector¡¯s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.

At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had
obtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his
subordinates, and amongst them Dant¨¨s¡¯ jailer. A new governor arrived;
it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners; he
learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty
cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,
and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dant¨¨s¡ªhe was now
number 34.






Chapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27

Dant¨¨s passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in
suspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence
which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence,
which justified in some measure the governor¡¯s belief in his mental
alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his
supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource.
Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him
till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.

Dant¨¨s asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even
if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous, was
still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated to be
allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing materials.
His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the same. He
accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the latter
was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to speak to
a man, even though mute, was something. Dant¨¨s spoke for the sake of
hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound
of his voice terrified him.

Often, before his captivity, Dant¨¨s¡¯ mind had revolted at the idea of
assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers.
He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face
besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous
costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves
breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very
happy.

He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even
the mad abb¨¦. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant
sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he
had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered
so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the
latter sapiently imagined that Dant¨¨s wished to conspire or attempt an
escape, and refused his request. Dant¨¨s had exhausted all human
resources, and he then turned to God.

All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he
recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new
meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley
of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first
understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the
pity of heaven! He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the
sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid
every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to
accomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty
oftener addressed to man than to God: ¡°Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them that trespass against us.¡± Yet in spite of his earnest
prayers, Dant¨¨s remained a prisoner.

Then gloom settled heavily upon him. Dant¨¨s was a man of great
simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore,
in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of
the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the
ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination,
and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin¡¯s
Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so
short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen
years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could
come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus
revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to
one idea¡ªthat of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by an
unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea, devoured
it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of
Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.

Rage supplanted religious fervor. Dant¨¨s uttered blasphemies that made
his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the
walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon
himself, so that the least thing,¡ªa grain of sand, a straw, or a breath
of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that
Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed
forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene, mene, tekel upharsin
of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not
the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest
misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible
tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient, because
after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at least the
boon of unconsciousness.

By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death,
and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be
invented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the brink
of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!

Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye;
but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling
with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus
ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is
over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state
of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that
precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of
consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of
which lie darkness and obscurity.

Edmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his
sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when
the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dant¨¨s reviewed his past life
with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future
existence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.

¡°Sometimes,¡± said he, ¡°in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded
other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the
storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with
its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled
and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight
of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then
terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a
sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was
happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of
rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a
creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls
and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to
life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner,
I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced
three thousand times round my cell,¡ªthat is thirty thousand steps, or
about ten leagues.¡±

No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more
composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and
slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that
he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods
of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his
handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation.
But the first was repugnant to him. Dant¨¨s had always entertained the
greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would
not die by what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the
second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.

0185m


Nearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had
ceased to mark the lapse of time. Dant¨¨s said, ¡°I wish to die,¡± and had
chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had
taken an oath to die. ¡°When my morning and evening meals are brought,¡±
thought he, ¡°I will cast them out of the window, and they will think
that I have eaten them.¡±

He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture,
the provisions his jailer brought him¡ªat first gayly, then with
deliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection of
his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once
repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at
a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted
fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life
contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less
sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young¡ªhe was only
four or five-and-twenty¡ªhe had nearly fifty years to live. What
unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to
liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary
Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would
not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient
strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next
morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously
ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.

Thus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him
which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at
his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes
he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o¡¯-the-wisps
that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious
country called Death!

Suddenly, about nine o¡¯clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound
in the wall against which he was lying.

So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did
not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his
faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond
raised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made
by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the
stones.

Although weakened, the young man¡¯s brain instantly responded to the idea
that haunts all prisoners¡ªliberty! It seemed to him that heaven had at
length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the
very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so
often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the
distance that separated them.

No, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams
that forerun death!

Edmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then
heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.

Some hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond
was intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.

For a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that
he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the
attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter
with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously
at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it,
and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last
moments.

The jailer brought him his breakfast. Dant¨¨s raised himself up and began
to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the
coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an
excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who
out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his
prisoner.

Fortunately, he fancied that Dant¨¨s was delirious; and placing the food
on the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became
more and more distinct.

¡°There can be no doubt about it,¡± thought he; ¡°it is some prisoner who
is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help
him!¡±

Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to
misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope¡ªthe idea that the noise
was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring
dungeon.

It was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It
was easy to call his jailer¡¯s attention to the noise, and watch his
countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes
far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own
curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmond¡¯s brain was still so feeble that he
could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one
means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned his
eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered
towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents
with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.

He had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that
shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much
food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and
returned to his couch¡ªhe did not wish to die. He soon felt that his
ideas became again collected¡ªhe could think, and strengthen his thoughts
by reasoning. Then he said to himself:

¡°I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is
a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work,
in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his
occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on
the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will
cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.¡±

Edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight
was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and
with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice.

At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.

Edmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound
was heard from the wall¡ªall was silent there.

Full of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and,
thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh
recovered.

The day passed away in utter silence¡ªnight came without recurrence of
the noise.

¡°It is a prisoner,¡± said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and
life and energy returned.

The night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.

In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions¡ªhe had already
devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for
the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of
the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and
so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he listened to
learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at the
prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a
captive as anxious for liberty as himself.

Three days passed¡ªseventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off by
minutes!

At length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time
that night, Dant¨¨s, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall,
fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He
moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and
then went back and listened.

The matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other
side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had
substituted a lever for a chisel.

Encouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the
indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around for
anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist
cement, and displace a stone.

He saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating
was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All
his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.
The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would
have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair had
nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been
removed.

0189m


Dant¨¨s had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of
the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor,
and it broke in pieces.

Dant¨¨s concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,
leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural
an accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in,
but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was
working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited
for day.

All night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his
way. Day came, the jailer entered. Dant¨¨s told him that the jug had
fallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went
grumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to
remove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised
the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.

Dant¨¨s heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the
sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by
the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored
uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of
removing the plaster that surrounded it.

The damp had rendered it friable, and Dant¨¨s was able to break it off¡ªin
small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped
off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years,
supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long
and two feet broad, might be formed.

The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours
he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six
years that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?

This idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with
the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the stone-
work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give strength
to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded. It
was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must remove from its
socket.

Dant¨¨s strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The
fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dant¨¨s
paused with anguish on his brow.

Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive
until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea
occurred to him¡ªhe smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.

The jailer always brought Dant¨¨s¡¯ soup in an iron saucepan; this
saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dant¨¨s had noticed that
it was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave
it to him or to his companion first.

The handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dant¨¨s would have given ten
years of his life in exchange for it.

0191m


The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into
Dant¨¨s¡¯ plate, and Dant¨¨s, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon,
washed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening came
Dant¨¨s put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he
entered, stepped on it and broke it.

This time he could not blame Dant¨¨s. He was wrong to leave it there, but
the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer,
therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour the
soup into; Dant¨¨s¡¯ entire dinner service consisted of one plate¡ªthere
was no alternative.

¡°Leave the saucepan,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°you can take it away when you bring
me my breakfast.¡±

This advice was to the jailer¡¯s taste, as it spared him the necessity of
making another trip. He left the saucepan.

Dant¨¨s was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and
after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and
return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted
the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and
employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dant¨¨s that all went
well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall,
leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.

Dant¨¨s carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of
his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use
of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work
without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his
bed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece
of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.

¡°Well, don¡¯t you intend to bring me another plate?¡± said Dant¨¨s.

¡°No,¡± replied the turnkey; ¡°you destroy everything. First you break your
jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed
your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the
saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you
will not be so destructive.¡±

Dant¨¨s raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the
coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of
iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that
the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was
a greater reason for proceeding¡ªif his neighbor would not come to him,
he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the
evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and
fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer¡¯s visit arrived, Dant¨¨s
straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed
it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into
it, together with the fish¡ªfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived
of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dant¨¨s
long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired.

Dant¨¨s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to
work. He listened¡ªall was silent, as it had been for the last three
days. Dant¨¨s sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him.
However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after
two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no
impression, but met with a smooth surface; Dant¨¨s touched it, and found
that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole
Dant¨¨s had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it.
The unhappy young man had not thought of this.

¡°Oh, my God, my God!¡± murmured he, ¡°I have so earnestly prayed to you,
that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my
liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to
existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!¡±

0193m


¡°Who talks of God and despair at the same time?¡± said a voice that
seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance,
sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man¡¯s ears. Edmond¡¯s hair
stood on end, and he rose to his knees.

¡°Ah,¡± said he, ¡°I hear a human voice.¡± Edmond had not heard anyone speak
save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a
prisoner¡ªhe is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding
strength to restraints of oak and iron.

¡°In the name of Heaven,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, ¡°speak again, though the sound of
your voice terrifies me. Who are you?¡±

¡°Who are you?¡± said the voice.

¡°An unhappy prisoner,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, who made no hesitation in
answering.

¡°Of what country?¡±

¡°A Frenchman.¡±

¡°Your name?¡±

¡°Edmond Dant¨¨s.¡±

¡°Your profession?¡±

¡°A sailor.¡±

¡°How long have you been here?¡±

¡°Since the 28th of February, 1815.¡±

¡°Your crime?¡±

¡°I am innocent.¡±

¡°But of what are you accused?¡±

¡°Of having conspired to aid the emperor¡¯s return.¡±

¡°What! For the emperor¡¯s return?¡ªthe emperor is no longer on the throne,
then?¡±

¡°He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of
Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all
this?¡±

¡°Since 1811.¡±

Dant¨¨s shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in
prison.

¡°Do not dig any more,¡± said the voice; ¡°only tell me how high up is your
excavation?¡±

¡°On a level with the floor.¡±

¡°How is it concealed?¡±

¡°Behind my bed.¡±

¡°Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°What does your chamber open on?¡±

¡°A corridor.¡±

¡°And the corridor?¡±

¡°On a court.¡±

¡°Alas!¡± murmured the voice.

¡°Oh, what is the matter?¡± cried Dant¨¨s.

¡°I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong
angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the
wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.¡±

¡°But then you would be close to the sea?¡±

¡°That is what I hoped.¡±

¡°And supposing you had succeeded?¡±

¡°I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands
near here¡ªthe Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen¡ªand then I should
have been safe.¡±

¡°Could you have swum so far?¡±

¡°Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.¡±

¡°All?¡±

¡°Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait
until you hear from me.¡±

¡°Tell me, at least, who you are?¡±

¡°I am¡ªI am No. 27.¡±

¡°You mistrust me, then,¡± said Dant¨¨s. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter
laugh resounding from the depths.

¡°Oh, I am a Christian,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, guessing instinctively that this
man meant to abandon him. ¡°I swear to you by him who died for us that
naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I
conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have got
to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the
wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.¡±

¡°How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.¡±

¡°I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been
here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested,
the 28th of February, 1815.¡±

¡°Not quite twenty-six!¡± murmured the voice; ¡°at that age he cannot be a
traitor.¡±

¡°Oh, no, no,¡± cried Dant¨¨s. ¡°I swear to you again, rather than betray
you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!¡±

¡°You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was
about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me. I
will not forget you. Wait.¡±

¡°How long?¡±

¡°I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.¡±

¡°But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come
to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of
those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love
somebody?¡±

¡°No, I am alone in the world.¡±

¡°Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you
are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet
lives; I only love him and a young girl called Merc¨¦d¨¨s. My father has
not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me
still; I shall love you as I loved my father.¡±

¡°It is well,¡± returned the voice; ¡°tomorrow.¡±

These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his
sincerity; Dant¨¨s rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution
as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave
himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was,
perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a
companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints
made in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are
gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.

All day Dant¨¨s walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on
his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he
bounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind
that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and
then his mind was made up¡ªwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to
examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be
condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this
miraculous noise recalled him to life.

The jailer came in the evening. Dant¨¨s was on his bed. It seemed to him
that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was
a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, ¡°Come, are you
going mad again?¡±

Dant¨¨s did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would
betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dant¨¨s
hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but
he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed
from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.

¡°Is it you?¡± said he; ¡°I am here.¡±

¡°Is your jailer gone?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°he will not return until the evening; so that we
have twelve hours before us.¡±

¡°I can work, then?¡± said the voice.

¡°Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.¡±

In a moment that part of the floor on which Dant¨¨s was resting his two
hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he
drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a
hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from
the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to
measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly
the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.

Chapter 16. A Learned Italian

Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dant¨¨s
almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view
of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through
the grating.

He was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering
and sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost
buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black)
beard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by
care, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a
man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical
strength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow,
while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could
only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.

The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a
certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it
probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.
He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with
evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and
invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him
with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at
that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where
he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.

¡°Let us first see,¡± said he, ¡°whether it is possible to remove the
traces of my entrance here¡ªour future tranquillity depends upon our
jailers being entirely ignorant of it.¡±

Advancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in
spite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:

¡°You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools
to aid you.¡±

¡°Why,¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s, with astonishment, ¡°do you possess any?¡±

¡°I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that
are necessary,¡ªa chisel, pincers, and lever.¡±

0201m


¡°Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and
patience.¡±

¡°Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.¡±

So saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of
beechwood.

¡°And with what did you contrive to make that?¡± inquired Dant¨¨s.

¡°With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed
me to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about
fifty feet.¡±

¡°Fifty feet!¡± responded Dant¨¨s, almost terrified.

¡°Do not speak so loud, young man¡ªdon¡¯t speak so loud. It frequently
occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside
the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the
prisoners.¡±

¡°But they believe I am shut up alone here.¡±

¡°That makes no difference.¡±

¡°And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get
here?¡±

¡°I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine;
only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the necessary
geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion, instead of
taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I expected, as I told
you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into
the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber
opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I find
that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.¡±

¡°That¡¯s true,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°but the corridor you speak of only bounds
one side of my cell; there are three others¡ªdo you know anything of
their situation?¡±

¡°This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten
experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many
years to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor¡¯s
apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into
some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The
fourth and last side of your cell faces on¡ªfaces on¡ªstop a minute, now
where does it face?¡±

The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole
by which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which
gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening
through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security,
furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in
the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a
prisoner¡¯s escape. As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the
table beneath the window.

¡°Climb up,¡± said he to Dant¨¨s.

The young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of
his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out
both hands. The stranger, whom as yet Dant¨¨s knew only by the number of
his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a
person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a
lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dant¨¨s, and
from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the
dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his
head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a
perfect view from top to bottom.

An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, ¡°I thought
so!¡± and sliding from the shoulders of Dant¨¨s as dextrously as he had
ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.

¡°What was it that you thought?¡± asked the young man anxiously, in his
turn descending from the table.

The elder prisoner pondered the matter. ¡°Yes,¡± said he at length, ¡°it is
so. This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery,
where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and
night.¡±

¡°Are you quite sure of that?¡±

¡°Certain. I saw the soldier¡¯s shape and the top of his musket; that made
me draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also see me.¡±

¡°Well?¡± inquired Dant¨¨s.

¡°You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your
dungeon?¡±

¡°Then¡ª¡ª¡± pursued the young man eagerly.

¡°Then,¡± answered the elder prisoner, ¡°the will of God be done!¡± And as
the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound
resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance. Dant¨¨s gazed on
the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently
nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.

¡°Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?¡± said he at length.
¡°Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.¡±

¡°Willingly,¡± answered the stranger; ¡°if, indeed, you feel any curiosity
respecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.¡±

¡°Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own
powerful mind. Pray let me know who you really are?¡±

The stranger smiled a melancholy smile. ¡°Then listen,¡± said he. ¡°I am
the Abb¨¦ Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this Chateau
d¡¯If since the year 1811; previously to which I had been confined for
three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In the year 1811 I was
transferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I learned that
the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon,
had bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his cradle. I was
very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of;
namely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be
overthrown. Then who reigns in France at this moment¡ªNapoleon II.?¡±

¡°No, Louis XVIII.¡±

¡°The brother of Louis XVI.! How inscrutable are the ways of
Providence¡ªfor what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven
to abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so abased?¡±

Dant¨¨s¡¯ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his
own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.

¡°Yes, yes,¡± continued he, ¡°¡¯Twill be the same as it was in England.
After Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles II., and then James
II., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince of Orange, a
stadtholder who becomes a king. Then new concessions to the people, then
a constitution, then liberty. Ah, my friend!¡± said the abb¨¦, turning
towards Dant¨¨s, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet,
¡°you are young, you will see all this come to pass.¡±

¡°Probably, if ever I get out of prison!¡±

¡°True,¡± replied Faria, ¡°we are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes,
and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond
these walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.¡±

¡°But wherefore are you here?¡±

¡°Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in
1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political face
of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of
petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler, I
sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly,
because I fancied I had found my C?sar Borgia in a crowned simpleton,
who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. It was the plan of
Alexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed now, for they
attempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to complete his work.
Italy seems fated to misfortune.¡± And the old man bowed his head.

Dant¨¨s could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.
Napoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and
spoken with him; but of Clement VII. and Alexander VI. he knew nothing.

¡°Are you not,¡± he asked, ¡°the priest who here in the Chateau d¡¯If is
generally thought to be¡ªill?¡±

¡°Mad, you mean, don¡¯t you?¡±

¡°I did not like to say so,¡± answered Dant¨¨s, smiling.

¡°Well, then,¡± resumed Faria with a bitter smile, ¡°let me answer your
question in full, by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of
the Chateau d¡¯If, for many years permitted to amuse the different
visitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all probability, I
should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children, if
such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to
suffering and despair.¡±

Dant¨¨s remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he said:

¡°Then you abandon all hope of escape?¡±

¡°I perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to
attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.¡±

¡°Nay, be not discouraged. Would it not be expecting too much to hope to
succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in another
direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?¡±

¡°Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to
effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning
over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I
possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as
granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove
huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days
have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid
if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this
hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the
stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug
up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits
of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so
completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add
another handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also that
I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking,
for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold
out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when I
reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat
again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at
variance with the Almighty¡¯s pleasure.¡±

Dant¨¨s held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the
thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the
failure of the abb¨¦¡¯s plans.

The abb¨¦ sank upon Edmond¡¯s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing.
Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some things
which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an
instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet¡ªto devote three years to
a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice
overhanging the sea¡ªto plunge into the waves from the height of fifty,
sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces
against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped
the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past,
then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles
ere you could reach the shore¡ªwere difficulties so startling and
formidable that Dant¨¨s had never even dreamed of such a scheme,
resigning himself rather to death.

But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a
courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new
courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he
had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only
because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost
incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself
with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done
all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dant¨¨s? Faria had dug his way
through fifty feet, Dant¨¨s would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of
fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old,
would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the
idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to
one of the islands¡ªDaume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor,
an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should
he, who had so often for mere amusement¡¯s sake plunged to the bottom of
the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the
same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for
pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long! At
once Dant¨¨s resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic
companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done
again.

After continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man
suddenly exclaimed, ¡°I have found what you were in search of!¡±

Faria started: ¡°Have you, indeed?¡± cried he, raising his head with quick
anxiety; ¡°pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?¡±

¡°The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you
occupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does it
not?¡±

0207m


¡°It does.¡±

¡°And is not above fifteen feet from it?¡±

¡°About that.¡±

¡°Well, then, I will tell you what we must do. We must pierce through the
corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top
part of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately; we
shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel who
guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is
courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient
in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours¡ªyou shall now see
me prove mine.¡±

¡°One instant, my dear friend,¡± replied the abb¨¦; ¡°it is clear you do not
understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what
use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider that I
have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of
the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day. But
then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention), then
I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in
trying to set an innocent being at liberty¡ªone who had committed no
offence, and merited not condemnation.¡±

¡°And have your notions changed?¡± asked Dant¨¨s with much surprise; ¡°do
you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have
encountered me?¡±

¡°No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself
merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no
sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so
easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.¡±

A slight movement of surprise escaped Dant¨¨s.

¡°Is it possible,¡± said he, ¡°that where your liberty is at stake you can
allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?¡±

¡°Tell me,¡± replied Faria, ¡°what has hindered you from knocking down your
jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself
in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?¡±

¡°Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,¡± answered Dant¨¨s.

¡°Because,¡± said the old man, ¡°the natural repugnance to the commission
of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is
because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us
from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature
teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell
to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this
instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to
spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of
blood¡ªit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a
shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and
physiological formation¡ª¡ª¡±

Dant¨¨s was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which
had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there
are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and
those that emanate from the heart.

0209m


¡°Since my imprisonment,¡± said Faria, ¡°I have thought over all the most
celebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely been successful.
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated
upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the
Duc de Beaufort from the Chateau de Vincennes, that of the Abb¨¦ Dubuquoi
from For l¡¯Ev¨ºque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are those for
which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of
all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and
when it presents itself, profit by it.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°you might well endure the tedious delay; you were
constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with
toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.¡±

¡°I assure you,¡± replied the old man, ¡°I did not turn to that source for
recreation or support.¡±

¡°What did you do then?¡±

¡°I wrote or studied.¡±

¡°Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± answered the abb¨¦; ¡°I had none but what I made for myself.¡±

¡°You made paper, pens and ink?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

Dant¨¨s gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.
Faria saw this.

¡°When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,¡± said he, ¡°I will
show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of
my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the
Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark¡¯s column at Venice, and on
the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that
they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Chateau d¡¯If.
The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General
Monarchy in Italy, and will make one large quarto volume.¡±

¡°And on what have you written all this?¡±

¡°On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as
smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.¡±

¡°You are, then, a chemist?¡±

¡°Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.¡±

¡°But for such a work you must have needed books¡ªhad you any?¡±

¡°I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after
reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and
fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of
all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted
three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and
fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have
been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall
their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me. I
could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus
Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare,
Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most important.¡±

¡°You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to
have been able to read all these?¡±

¡°Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues¡ªthat is to say, German, French,
Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned
modern Greek¡ªI don¡¯t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am still
trying to improve myself.¡±

¡°Improve yourself!¡± repeated Dant¨¨s; ¡°why, how can you manage to do so?¡±

¡°Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and
arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their
medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is
absolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred
thousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I
certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;
and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.¡±

Stronger grew the wonder of Dant¨¨s, who almost fancied he had to do with
one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some
imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he
added, ¡°Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to
write the work you speak of?¡±

¡°I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred
to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings are served
to us on maigre days. Well, I selected the cartilages of the heads of
these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I
welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as
affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely
confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and
relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing
at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a
prisoner.¡±

¡°But the ink,¡± said Dant¨¨s; ¡°of what did you make your ink?¡±

¡°There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,¡± replied Faria, ¡°but it
was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it
must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a
coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought
to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For
very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked
one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.¡±

¡°And when,¡± asked Dant¨¨s, ¡°may I see all this?¡±

¡°Whenever you please,¡± replied the abb¨¦.

¡°Oh, then let it be directly!¡± exclaimed the young man.

¡°Follow me, then,¡± said the abb¨¦, as he re-entered the subterranean
passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dant¨¨s.






Chapter 17. The Abb¨¦¡¯s Chamber

After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean
passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves
erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into
which the abb¨¦¡¯s cell opened; from that point the passage became much
narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.
The floor of the abb¨¦¡¯s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one
of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to
commence the laborious task of which Dant¨¨s had witnessed the
completion.

As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dant¨¨s cast around one eager
and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more
than common met his view.

¡°It is well,¡± said the abb¨¦; ¡°we have some hours before us¡ªit is now
just a quarter past twelve o¡¯clock.¡± Instinctively Dant¨¨s turned round
to observe by what watch or clock the abb¨¦ had been able so accurately
to specify the hour.

¡°Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,¡± said the abb¨¦,
¡°and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these
lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and
the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the
precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that
might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth
never vary in their appointed paths.¡±

This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dant¨¨s, who had always
imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in
the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement
of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared
to him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion¡¯s
lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging
out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which
he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his
earliest youth.

¡°Come,¡± said he to the abb¨¦, ¡°I am anxious to see your treasures.¡±

The abb¨¦ smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by
the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the
hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a
safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dant¨¨s.

0213m


¡°What do you wish to see first?¡± asked the abb¨¦.

¡°Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!¡±

Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of
linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls
consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long;
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so
legible that Dant¨¨s could easily read it, as well as make out the
sense¡ªit being in Italian, a language he, as a Proven?al, perfectly
understood.

¡°There,¡± said he, ¡°there is the work complete. I wrote the word finis at
the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up two
of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete
the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find in all
Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my
literary reputation is forever secured.¡±

¡°I see,¡± answered Dant¨¨s. ¡°Now let me behold the curious pens with which
you have written your work.¡±

¡°Look!¡± said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six
inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine
painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one
of those cartilages of which the abb¨¦ had before spoken to Dant¨¨s; it
was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dant¨¨s
examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the
instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.

¡°Ah, yes,¡± said Faria; ¡°the penknife. That¡¯s my masterpiece. I made it,
as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.¡± The
penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would
serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.

Dant¨¨s examined the various articles shown to him with the same
attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools
exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the
South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading
vessels.

¡°As for the ink,¡± said Faria, ¡°I told you how I managed to obtain
that¡ªand I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.¡±

¡°One thing still puzzles me,¡± observed Dant¨¨s, ¡°and that is how you
managed to do all this by daylight?¡±

¡°I worked at night also,¡± replied Faria.

¡°Night!¡ªwhy, for Heaven¡¯s sake, are your eyes like cats¡¯, that you can
see to work in the dark?¡±

¡°Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence
that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I
furnished myself with a light.¡±

¡°You did? Pray tell me how.¡±

¡°I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made
oil¡ªhere is my lamp.¡± So saying, the abb¨¦ exhibited a sort of torch very
similar to those used in public illuminations.

¡°But how do you procure a light?¡±

¡°Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.¡±

¡°And matches?¡±

¡°I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little
sulphur, which was readily supplied.¡±

Dant¨¨s laid the different things he had been looking at on the table,
and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by
the perseverance and strength of Faria¡¯s mind.

0215m


¡°You have not seen all yet,¡± continued Faria, ¡°for I did not think it
wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut
this one up.¡± They put the stone back in its place; the abb¨¦ sprinkled a
little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed,
rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the
other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it
stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting
in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this
space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
Dant¨¨s closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and
compact enough to bear any weight.

¡°Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?¡±

¡°I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets
of my bed, during my three years¡¯ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when
I was removed to the Chateau d¡¯If, I managed to bring the ravellings
with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.¡±

¡°And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?¡±

¡°Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the
edges over again.¡±

¡°With what?¡±

¡°With this needle,¡± said the abb¨¦, as, opening his ragged vestments, he
showed Dant¨¨s a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for
the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.

¡°I once thought,¡± continued Faria, ¡°of removing these iron bars, and
letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat
wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more
preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely
have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the
project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I
carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen
opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance
frequently brings about.¡±

While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind
of Dant¨¨s was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so
intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abb¨¦ might probably be
able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself
could see nothing.

¡°What are you thinking of?¡± asked the abb¨¦ smilingly, imputing the deep
abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe
and wonder.

¡°I was reflecting, in the first place,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°upon the
enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to
reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not
have accomplished if you had been free?¡±

¡°Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a
state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is
needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my
mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the
collision of clouds electricity is produced¡ªfrom electricity, lightning,
from lightning, illumination.¡±

¡°No,¡± replied Dant¨¨s. ¡°I know nothing. Some of your words are to me
quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the
knowledge you have.¡±

The abb¨¦ smiled. ¡°Well,¡± said he, ¡°but you had another subject for your
thoughts; did you not say so just now?¡±

¡°I did!¡±

¡°You have told me as yet but one of them¡ªlet me hear the other.¡±

¡°It was this,¡ªthat while you had related to me all the particulars of
your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.¡±

¡°Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit
of your having passed through any very important events.¡±

¡°It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved
misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no
longer vent reproaches upon Heaven.¡±

¡°Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?¡±

¡°I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon
earth,¡ªmy father and Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

¡°Come,¡± said the abb¨¦, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed
back to its original situation, ¡°let me hear your story.¡±

Dant¨¨s obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three
voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last
cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet
to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that
personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter
addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier¡ªhis arrival at Marseilles, and
interview with his father¡ªhis affection for Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and their nuptual
feast¡ªhis arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at
the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Chateau d¡¯If.
From this point everything was a blank to Dant¨¨s¡ªhe knew nothing more,
not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital
finished, the abb¨¦ reflected long and earnestly.

¡°There is,¡± said he, at the end of his meditations, ¡°a clever maxim,
which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and
that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved
mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.
Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and
false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within
us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and
wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you
visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover
the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any
way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,¡ªto whom could your
disappearance have been serviceable?¡±

¡°To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.¡±

¡°Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy;
everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands
in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of
a place. Now, in the event of the king¡¯s death, his successor inherits a
crown,¡ªwhen the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes,
and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve
thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the
twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from the highest to the lowest
degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy
passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes¡¯ theory of pressure
and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we
have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on
the base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were
on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the
accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question
as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain
of the Pharaon. What say you?¡±

¡°I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and
had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I
feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one
person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had
quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to
fight me; but he refused.¡±

¡°Now we are getting on. And what was this man¡¯s name?¡±

¡°Danglars.¡±

¡°What rank did he hold on board?¡±

¡°He was supercargo.¡±

¡°And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his
employment?¡±

¡°Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed
inaccuracies in his accounts.¡±

¡°Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last
conversation with Captain Leclere?¡±

¡°No; we were quite alone.¡±

¡°Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?¡±

¡°It might, for the cabin door was open¡ªand¡ªstay; now I
recollect,¡ªDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving
me the packet for the grand marshal.¡±

¡°That¡¯s better,¡± cried the abb¨¦; ¡°now we are on the right scent. Did you
take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?¡±

¡°Nobody.¡±

¡°Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of
it, I think?¡±

¡°Yes; the grand marshal did.¡±

¡°And what did you do with that letter?¡±

¡°Put it into my portfolio.¡±

¡°You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find
room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official
letter?¡±

¡°You are right; it was left on board.¡±

¡°Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in
the portfolio?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°And what did you do with this same letter while returning from Porto-
Ferrajo to the vessel?¡±

¡°I carried it in my hand.¡±

¡°So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that
you held a letter in your hand?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Danglars, as well as the rest?¡±

¡°Danglars, as well as others.¡±

¡°Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your
arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you
was formulated?¡±

¡°Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my
memory.¡±

¡°Repeat it to me.¡±

Dant¨¨s paused a moment, then said, ¡°This is it, word for word: ¡®The
king¡¯s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that
one Edmond Dant¨¨s, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived from
Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been
intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper,
with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt
may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found
either about his person, at his father¡¯s residence, or in his cabin on
board the Pharaon.¡¯¡±

The abb¨¦ shrugged his shoulders. ¡°The thing is clear as day,¡± said he;
¡°and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart,
not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.¡±

¡°Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.¡±

¡°How did Danglars usually write?¡±

¡°In a handsome, running hand.¡±

¡°And how was the anonymous letter written?¡±

¡°Backhanded.¡±

Again the abb¨¦ smiled. ¡°Disguised.¡±

¡°It was very boldly written, if disguised.¡±

¡°Stop a bit,¡± said the abb¨¦, taking up what he called his pen, and,
after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,
with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.
Dant¨¨s drew back, and gazed on the abb¨¦ with a sensation almost
amounting to terror.

¡°How very astonishing!¡± cried he at length. ¡°Why your writing exactly
resembles that of the accusation.¡±

¡°Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and
I have noticed that¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand
varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.¡±

¡°You have evidently seen and observed everything.¡±

¡°Let us proceed.¡±

¡°Oh, yes, yes!¡±

¡°Now as regards the second question.¡±

¡°I am listening.¡±

¡°Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage
with Merc¨¦d¨¨s?¡±

¡°Yes; a young man who loved her.¡±

¡°And his name was¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Fernand.¡±

¡°That is a Spanish name, I think?¡±

¡°He was a Catalan.¡±

¡°You imagine him capable of writing the letter?¡±

¡°Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife
into me.¡±

¡°That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an
assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,
never.¡±

¡°Besides,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°the various circumstances mentioned in the
letter were wholly unknown to him.¡±

¡°You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?¡±

¡°To no one.¡±

¡°Not even to your mistress?¡±

¡°No, not even to my betrothed.¡±

¡°Then it is Danglars.¡±

¡°I feel quite sure of it now.¡±

¡°Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?¡±

¡°No¡ªyes, he was. Now I recollect¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at P¨¨re
Pamphile¡¯s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in
earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand
looked pale and agitated.¡±

¡°Were they alone?¡±

¡°There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who
had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!¡ªstay!¡ªHow strange that it
should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that
on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s, pressing
his hand to his throbbing brows.

¡°Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the
villany of your friends?¡± inquired the abb¨¦ with a laugh.

¡°Yes, yes,¡± replied Dant¨¨s eagerly; ¡°I would beg of you, who see so
completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery
seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent
no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was
condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?¡±

¡°That is altogether a different and more serious matter,¡± responded the
abb¨¦. ¡°The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be
easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been
child¡¯s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of
the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every
point.¡±

¡°Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see
more clearly into my life than I do myself.¡±

¡°In the first place, then, who examined you,¡ªthe king¡¯s attorney, his
deputy, or a magistrate?¡±

¡°The deputy.¡±

¡°Was he young or old?¡±

¡°About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.¡±

¡°So,¡± answered the abb¨¦. ¡°Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to
be corrupt. And how did he treat you?¡±

¡°With more of mildness than severity.¡±

¡°Did you tell him your whole story?¡±

¡°I did.¡±

¡°And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?¡±

¡°He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought
me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.¡±

¡°By your misfortune?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?¡±

¡°He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.¡±

¡°And that?¡±

¡°He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.¡±

¡°What? the accusation?¡±

¡°No; the letter.¡±

¡°Are you sure?¡±

¡°I saw it done.¡±

¡°That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel
than you have thought possible.¡±

¡°Upon my word,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°you make me shudder. Is the world filled
with tigers and crocodiles?¡±

¡°Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
dangerous than the others.¡±

¡°Never mind; let us go on.¡±

¡°With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?¡±

¡°He did; saying at the same time, ¡®You see I thus destroy the only proof
existing against you.¡¯¡±

¡°This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.¡±

¡°You think so?¡±

¡°I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?¡±

¡°To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-H¨¦ron, No. 13, Paris.¡±

¡°Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?¡±

¡°Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me
promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring
me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he
insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in
the address.¡±

¡°Noirtier!¡± repeated the abb¨¦; ¡°Noirtier!¡ªI knew a person of that name
at the court of the Queen of Etruria,¡ªa Noirtier, who had been a
Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?¡±

¡°De Villefort!¡± The abb¨¦ burst into a fit of laughter, while Dant¨¨s
gazed on him in utter astonishment.

¡°What ails you?¡± said he at length.

¡°Do you see that ray of sunlight?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.
Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed
great sympathy and commiseration for you?¡±

¡°He did.¡±

¡°And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this
Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This
Noirtier was his father!¡±

Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dant¨¨s, or hell opened its
yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely
transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected
words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to
prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, ¡°His father! his
father!¡±

¡°Yes, his father,¡± replied the abb¨¦; ¡°his right name was Noirtier de
Villefort.¡±

At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dant¨¨s, and
cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that
had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the
letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the
magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce
punishment,¡ªall returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried
out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried
to the opening that led from the abb¨¦¡¯s cell to his own, and said, ¡°I
must be alone, to think over all this.¡±

When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the
turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and
contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours
of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had
formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a
solemn oath.

Dant¨¨s was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who,
having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-
sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his mind,
though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abb¨¦
unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter
quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a
small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abb¨¦ had come to
ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.

Dant¨¨s followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now
wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance
that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria
bent on him his penetrating eye.

¡°I regret now,¡± said he, ¡°having helped you in your late inquiries, or
having given you the information I did.¡±

¡°Why so?¡± inquired Dant¨¨s.

¡°Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart¡ªthat of
vengeance.¡±

Dant¨¨s smiled. ¡°Let us talk of something else,¡± said he.

Again the abb¨¦ looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in
accordance with Dant¨¨s¡¯ request, he began to speak of other matters. The
elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of
all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and
important hints as well as sound information; but it was never
egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
Dant¨¨s listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his
remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort
of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the
good abb¨¦¡¯s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but,
like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened
new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic
glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an
intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria
along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.

¡°You must teach me a small part of what you know,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°if only
to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned
a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented
with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you
will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another
word about escaping.¡±

The abb¨¦ smiled.

¡°Alas, my boy,¡± said he, ¡°human knowledge is confined within very narrow
limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and
the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will
know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for
me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.¡±

¡°Two years!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s; ¡°do you really believe I can acquire all
these things in so short a time?¡±

¡°Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to
learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory
makes the one, philosophy the other.¡±

¡°But cannot one learn philosophy?¡±

¡°Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to
truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into
heaven.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°What shall you teach me first? I am in a
hurry to begin. I want to learn.¡±

¡°Everything,¡± said the abb¨¦. And that very evening the prisoners
sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.
Dant¨¨s possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind
rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally
poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality
of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He
already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic
dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two
languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so
that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and
German.

In strict accordance with the promise made to the abb¨¦, Dant¨¨s spoke no
more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no
room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his
word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in
any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by
unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year
Dant¨¨s was a new man. Dant¨¨s observed, however, that Faria, in spite of
the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed
incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall
into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,
and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.
One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:

¡°Ah, if there were no sentinel!¡±

¡°There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,¡± said Dant¨¨s,
who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his
brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest
operations.

¡°I have already told you,¡± answered the abb¨¦, ¡°that I loathe the idea of
shedding blood.¡±

¡°And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a
measure of self-preservation.¡±

¡°No matter! I could never agree to it.¡±

¡°Still, you have thought of it?¡±

¡°Incessantly, alas!¡± cried the abb¨¦.

¡°And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you
not?¡± asked Dant¨¨s eagerly.

¡°I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in
the gallery beyond us.¡±

¡°He shall be both blind and deaf,¡± replied the young man, with an air of
determination that made his companion shudder.

¡°No, no,¡± cried the abb¨¦; ¡°impossible!¡±

Dant¨¨s endeavored to renew the subject; the abb¨¦ shook his head in token
of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months
passed away.

¡°Are you strong?¡± the abb¨¦ asked one day of Dant¨¨s. The young man, in
reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and
then as readily straightened it.

¡°And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last
resort?¡±

¡°I promise on my honor.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°we may hope to put our design into execution.¡±

¡°And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?¡±

¡°At least a year.¡±

¡°And shall we begin at once?¡±

¡°At once.¡±

¡°We have lost a year to no purpose!¡± cried Dant¨¨s.

¡°Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?¡± asked the
abb¨¦.

¡°Forgive me!¡± cried Edmond, blushing deeply.

¡°Tut, tut!¡± answered the abb¨¦, ¡°man is but man after all, and you are
about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me
show you my plan.¡±

The abb¨¦ then showed Dant¨¨s the sketch he had made for their escape. It
consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dant¨¨s, with the passage
which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they
do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately
beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large
excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the
gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment
it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his
fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dant¨¨s before he had
power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to make their way
through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the
outer walls by means of the abb¨¦¡¯s ladder of cords.

Dant¨¨s¡¯ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at
the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed. That
very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity
proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of
ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except
the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in
anticipation of the turnkey¡¯s visits. They had learned to distinguish
the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards
their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his
coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which
would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees
and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria¡¯s or
Dant¨¨s¡¯ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the
night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to
remain.

More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools
for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still
continuing to instruct Dant¨¨s by conversing with him, sometimes in one
language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history
of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and
trodden the path of glory. The abb¨¦ was a man of the world, and had,
moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of
melancholy dignity which Dant¨¨s, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed
on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and
politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed
except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with
persons of high birth and breeding.

At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation
completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear
the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their
heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to
favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till
that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest
the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way
before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided
against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in
the walls through which they had worked their way. Dant¨¨s was occupied
in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in
Edmond¡¯s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-
ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dant¨¨s
hastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of
the room, pale as death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and
his hands clenched tightly together.

¡°Gracious heavens!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s, ¡°what is the matter? what has
happened?¡±

¡°Quick! quick!¡± returned the abb¨¦, ¡°listen to what I have to say.¡±

Dant¨¨s looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,
whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,
while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed
to stand on end.

¡°Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?¡± cried Dant¨¨s, letting his
chisel fall to the floor.

¡°Alas,¡± faltered out the abb¨¦, ¡°all is over with me. I am seized with a
terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast
approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my
imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what
that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet
that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the
purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with
a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me¡ªor rather¡ªno, no!¡ªI may be found
here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to
drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may
last?¡±

In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly
frustrated his hopes, Dant¨¨s did not lose his presence of mind, but
descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him;
then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abb¨¦¡¯s
chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.

¡°Thanks,¡± said the poor abb¨¦, shivering as though his veins were filled
with ice. ¡°I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it
comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though
dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms
may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions,
foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard,
for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another
part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite
motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,¡ªbe
careful about this,¡ªforce open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight
to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I
may perhaps revive.¡±

¡°Perhaps!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s in grief-stricken tones.

¡°Help! help!¡± cried the abb¨¦, ¡°I¡ªI¡ªdie¡ªI¡ª¡ª¡±

0229m


So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was
unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole
frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one
side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself
about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dant¨¨s
prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The
fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and
paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under
foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as
rigid as a corpse.

Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,
taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed
jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and
anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave
no sign of returning animation. Dant¨¨s began to fear he had delayed too
long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his
hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length
a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the
dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer
made a feeble effort to move.

¡°He is saved! he is saved!¡± cried Dant¨¨s in a paroxysm of delight.

The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident
anxiety towards the door. Dant¨¨s listened, and plainly distinguished the
approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o¡¯clock;
but Edmond¡¯s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.

The young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully
drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had
scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner
seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned
in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away
in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dant¨¨s, whose restless anxiety
concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him,
hurried back to the abb¨¦¡¯s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing
his head against it, was soon beside the sick man¡¯s couch. Faria had now
fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and
exhausted on his miserable bed.

¡°I did not expect to see you again,¡± said he feebly, to Dant¨¨s.

¡°And why not?¡± asked the young man. ¡°Did you fancy yourself dying?¡±

¡°No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I
thought you might have made your escape.¡±

The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dant¨¨s.

¡°Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?¡±

¡°At least,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°I now see how wrong such an opinion would
have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this
attack.¡±

¡°Be of good cheer,¡± replied Dant¨¨s; ¡°your strength will return.¡± And as
he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his
hands. The abb¨¦ shook his head.

¡°The last attack I had,¡± said he, ¡°lasted but half an hour, and after it
I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right
arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has
been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will either
carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.¡±

¡°No, no,¡± cried Dant¨¨s; ¡°you are mistaken¡ªyou will not die! And your
third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at
liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with
a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every
requisite assistance.¡±

¡°My good Edmond,¡± answered the abb¨¦, ¡°be not deceived. The attack which
has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None
can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.¡±

¡°Well, we will wait,¡ªa week, a month, two months, if need be,¡ªand
meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our
flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able
to swim we will go.¡±

¡°I shall never swim again,¡± replied Faria. ¡°This arm is paralyzed; not
for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.¡±

The young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight,
perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.

¡°You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?¡± asked the abb¨¦. ¡°Depend
upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this
malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for
it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in
a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have
twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and
he predicted a similar end for me.¡±

0233m


¡°The physician may be mistaken!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s. ¡°And as for your poor
arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and
swim for both of us.¡±

¡°My son,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know
as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty
strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that
even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall remain
till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human
probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young and
active, delay not on my account, but fly¡ªgo¡ªI give you back your
promise.¡±

¡°It is well,¡± said Dant¨¨s. ¡°Then I shall also remain.¡± Then, rising and
extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man¡¯s head, he
slowly added, ¡°By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while
you live.¡±

Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.

¡°Thanks,¡± murmured the invalid, extending one hand. ¡°I accept. You may
one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But as
I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to
fill up the excavation beneath the soldier¡¯s gallery; he might, by
chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention
of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery
which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set
about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;
keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow till
after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the greatest
importance to communicate to you.¡±

Dant¨¨s took the hand of the abb¨¦ in his, and affectionately pressed it.
Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his
task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show
towards his aged friend.






Chapter 18. The Treasure

When Dant¨¨s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in
captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of
light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in
his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the
use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small
compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He
did not speak, but showed the paper to Dant¨¨s.

¡°What is that?¡± he inquired.

¡°Look at it,¡± said the abb¨¦ with a smile.

¡°I have looked at it with all possible attention,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°and I
only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters
inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.¡±

¡°This paper, my friend,¡± said Faria, ¡°I may now avow to you, since I
have the proof of your fidelity¡ªthis paper is my treasure, of which,
from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.¡±

The sweat started forth on Dant¨¨s¡¯ brow. Until this day and for how long
a time!¡ªhe had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought
upon the abb¨¦ the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy
Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria
had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a
return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so
painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental
alienation.

¡°Your treasure?¡± stammered Dant¨¨s. Faria smiled.

¡°Yes,¡± said he. ¡°You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by
your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this
moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dant¨¨s, and
if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes¡ªyou. No one
would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,
who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards
if you will.¡±

¡°Alas,¡± murmured Edmond to himself, ¡°this is a terrible relapse! There
was only this blow wanting.¡± Then he said aloud, ¡°My dear friend, your
attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?
Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to
nurse you carefully. Besides,¡± he said, ¡°a treasure is not a thing we
need hurry about.¡±

¡°On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!¡±
replied the old man. ¡°Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the
third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,
indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which
would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those
men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted
it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity.
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see
you, young and with a promising future,¡ªnow that I think of all that may
result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any
delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself
the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.¡±

Edmond turned away his head with a sigh.

¡°You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,¡± continued Faria. ¡°My words
have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this
paper, which I have never shown to anyone.¡±

¡°Tomorrow, my dear friend,¡± said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the
old man¡¯s madness. ¡°I thought it was understood that we should not talk
of that until tomorrow.¡±

¡°Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper today.¡±

¡°I will not irritate him,¡± thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of
which half was wanting,¡ªhaving been burnt, no doubt, by some
accident,¡ªhe read:

¡°this treasure, which may amount to two... of Roman crowns in the most
distant a... of the second opening wh... declare to belong to him alo...
heir. ¡°25th April, 149¡¯¡±

¡°Well!¡± said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.

¡°Why,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected
words, which are rendered illegible by fire.¡±

¡°Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for
me, who have grown pale over them by many nights¡¯ study, and have
reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.¡±

¡°And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?¡±

¡°I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to
the history of this paper.¡±

¡°Silence!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s. ¡°Steps approach¡ªI go¡ªadieu!¡±

And Dant¨¨s, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be
sure to confirm his belief in his friend¡¯s mental instability, glided
like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his
alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with
his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to
avoid discovery.

It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria¡¯s illness from the jailer,
had come in person to see him.

Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he
might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half
stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with
pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus
separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the
case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for
whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a
slight indisposition.

During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,
tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first
acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so
wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much
wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as
to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?

Dant¨¨s remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend,
thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for
all, that the abb¨¦ was mad¡ªsuch a conviction would be so terrible!

But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone
by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over
the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the
painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg
was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was
obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to
enter by the small aperture which led to Dant¨¨s¡¯ chamber.

¡°Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,¡± he said with a benignant smile.
¡°You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen to me.¡±

Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he
seated himself on the stool beside him.

¡°You know,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°that I was the secretary and intimate friend
of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this
worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich, although the
wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase
very often, ¡®As rich as a Spada.¡¯ But he, like public rumor, lived on
this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise. I was tutor to
his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the world, I tried
by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all he had done for
me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The cardinal¡¯s house had no
secrets for me. I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient
volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts. One day
when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring
the prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and,
smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of
Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI.,
were the following lines, which I can never forget:¡ª

¡°¡®The great wars of Romagna had ended; C?sar Borgia, who had completed
his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had also
need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France,
who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was
necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which
was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of
exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two
cardinals.¡¯

¡°By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich
men¡ªthis was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first place,
he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the
cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides.
There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.

¡°The pope and C?sar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they
were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the
Holy See, and C?sar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman
nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They
were ambitious, and C?sar Borgia soon found purchasers for their
appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being
cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals
held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns
entered into the coffers of the speculators.

0239m


¡°It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope
heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the
insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs
and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and C?sar Borgia
invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute
between the Holy Father and his son. C?sar thought they could make use
of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is
to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain
persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard.
This key was furnished with a small iron point,¡ªa negligence on the part
of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the
cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by
this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the
lion¡¯s head, which C?sar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a
clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of
twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.

¡°C?sar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals
to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI.
replied: ¡®Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us
ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that
money back. Besides, you forget, C?sar, an indigestion declares itself
immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.¡¯
C?sar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were
consequently invited to dinner.

¡°The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San
Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by
report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a
good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,
and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest
promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his
nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant
did not find him.

¡°Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so
eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a
centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ¡®C?sar wills that you
die.¡¯ but it was a legate ¨¤ latere, who came with a smile on his lips to
say from the pope, ¡®His holiness requests you to dine with him.¡¯

¡°Spada set out about two o¡¯clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited
him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his
nephew, in full costume, and C?sar Borgia paying him most marked
attentions. Spada turned pale, as C?sar looked at him with an ironical
air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was
well spread.

¡°They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if
he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly
comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had
already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the
pope¡¯s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him,
which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared
they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the
threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making
signs which his wife could not comprehend.

¡°Then C?sar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under
pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance
consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:¡ª¡®I
bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others,
my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in
remembrance of his affectionate uncle.¡¯

¡°The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the
furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was
really the most miserable of uncles¡ªno treasures¡ªunless they were those
of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all.
C?sar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing,
or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate,
and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his
wife before he expired: ¡®Look well among my uncle¡¯s papers; there is a
will.¡¯

¡°They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it
was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine
Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two
palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath
the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on.
Alexander VI. died, poisoned,¡ªyou know by what mistake. C?sar, poisoned
at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new
skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger¡¯s. Then,
compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a
night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.

¡°After the pope¡¯s death and his son¡¯s exile, it was supposed that the
Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the
cardinal¡¯s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in
doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public
rumor was, that C?sar, a better politician than his father, had carried
off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two,
because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was
completely despoiled.

¡°Up to this point,¡± said Faria, interrupting the thread of his
narrative, ¡°this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?¡±

¡°Oh, my friend,¡± cried Dant¨¨s, ¡°on the contrary, it seems as if I were
reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.¡±

¡°I will. The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years
rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others
diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some
were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I
was¡ªthe Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the
disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest
all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The
celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count¡¯s
possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular
clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be
regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious
veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic
characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it
before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.

¡°At the sight of papers of all sorts,¡ªtitles, contracts, parchments,
which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the
poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of
documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but
in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found¡ªnothing. Yet I had
read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the
sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had
occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal C?sar Spada; but could
only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi,
his companion in misfortune.

¡°I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the
Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures
of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the
eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand
and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three
hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count
of Spada in his poverty.

¡°My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his
library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All
these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in
ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for
the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and
history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear
Edmond, we are near the conclusion.

¡°In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death
of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently
how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the
thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to
a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence,
intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my
library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at
the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head
dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o¡¯clock in the
afternoon.

0243m


¡°I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter
darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find
one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which
I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in
one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my
match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the
small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use
of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then
recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the
table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had
served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the
heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it
into the expiring flame, set light to it.

¡°But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire
ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it
in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in
the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible
emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been
traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to
the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame.
It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dant¨¨s, and then
I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.¡±

Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dant¨¨s, who this
time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color
resembling rust:

¡°This 25th day of April, 1498, be... Alexander VI., and fearing that
not... he may desire to become my heir, and re... and Bentivoglio, who
were poisoned,... my sole heir, that I have bu... and has visited with
me, that is, in... Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss... jewels,

Two open... in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a... which
treasure I bequeath and leave en... as my sole heir. ¡°25th April, 1498.
¡°C?s... ¡°And now,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°read this other paper;¡± and he
presented to Dant¨¨s a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it,
which Edmond read as follows:

¡°...ing invited to dine by his Holiness ...content with making me pay
for my hat, ...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara ...I declare
to my nephew, Guido Spada ...ried in a place he knows ...the caves of

this treasure, which ...lions of Roman crowns, and which he ...ck from
the small ...ings have been made ...ngle in the second; ...tire to him
...ar ? Spada.¡±

Faria followed him with an excited look.

¡°And now,¡± he said, when he saw that Dant¨¨s had read the last line, ¡°put
the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.¡± Dant¨¨s obeyed, and
the conjointed pieces gave the following:

0245m


¡°This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness
Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my
hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate of

¡°25th April, 1498. ¡°C?s...ar ? Spada.¡±

¡°Well, do you comprehend now?¡± inquired Faria.

¡°It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought
for,¡± replied Edmond, still incredulous.

¡°Yes; a thousand times, yes!¡±

¡°And who completed it as it now is?¡±

¡°I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring
the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden
meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a
cavern by the small ray of light above us.¡±

¡°And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?¡±

¡°I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying
with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian
kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,
quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to
him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my
hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having
aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was
leaving Piombino.

¡°Now,¡± continued Faria, addressing Dant¨¨s with an almost paternal
expression, ¡°now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we
ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and
you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.¡±

¡°But,¡± inquired Dant¨¨s hesitating, ¡°has this treasure no more legitimate
possessor in the world than ourselves?¡±

¡°No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of
Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic
breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind
satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy
it without remorse.¡±

¡°And you say this treasure amounts to¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.¡±2

¡°Impossible!¡± said Dant¨¨s, staggered at the enormous amount.

¡°Impossible? and why?¡± asked the old man. ¡°The Spada family was one of
the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in
those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such
accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at
this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly
a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they
cannot touch.¡±

Edmond thought he was in a dream¡ªhe wavered between incredulity and joy.

¡°I have only kept this secret so long from you,¡± continued Faria, ¡°that
I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped
before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte
Cristo; now,¡± he added, with a sigh, ¡°it is you who will conduct me
thither. Well, Dant¨¨s, you do not thank me?¡±

¡°This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, ¡°and to
you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.¡±

¡°You are my son, Dant¨¨s,¡± exclaimed the old man. ¡°You are the child of
my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to
me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a
father, and the prisoner who could not get free.¡±

And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the
young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.






Chapter 19. The Third Attack

Now that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abb¨¦¡¯s
meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really
loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he
expatiated on the amount, explaining to Dant¨¨s all the good which, with
thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to
his friends; and then Dant¨¨s¡¯ countenance became gloomy, for the oath of
vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected how much
ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do
to his enemies.

The abb¨¦ did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant¨¨s knew it,
and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,
between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This
island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a
rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up
by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dant¨¨s
drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dant¨¨s advice as to
the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dant¨¨s was far
from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a
question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had
achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his
madness, increased Edmond¡¯s admiration of him; but at the same time
Dant¨¨s could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever
existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no
means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.

However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last
chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual
imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side,
which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it
completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dant¨¨s had
partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered,
the abb¨¦ had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still
greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they
would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more
inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their
hopes.

¡°You see,¡± said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to
Faria, ¡°that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for
what you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever with
you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure will
be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison. But
my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath
the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living
together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the
rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you
have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all
their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have
made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them,
and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them¡ªthis
is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich
and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons
of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as
the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take
for terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them.
To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent
speech,¡ªwhich embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my
whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be
free,¡ªso fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just
on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over
me; and this¡ªthis is my fortune¡ªnot chimerical, but actual. I owe you my
real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth,
even C?sar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.¡±

Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed
together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as
to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied
would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left
leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was
continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,
and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might
be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dant¨¨s to learn it by heart;
and Dant¨¨s knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed
the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would
be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while
Faria was giving instructions to Dant¨¨s,¡ªinstructions which were to
serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour
and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which
was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under
some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to
endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed
spot,¡ªthe appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in
the second opening.

In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and
foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had
gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his
youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who
learns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually
employed,¡ªFaria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dant¨¨s, for
fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his
memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for
them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose
activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of
Providence.

But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young
man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many
stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when
Edmond returned to his cell.

One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling
him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a
plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat
up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call
came from Faria¡¯s dungeon.

¡°Alas,¡± murmured Edmond; ¡°can it be?¡±

He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and
reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the
light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dant¨¨s
saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His
features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already
knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the
first time.

¡°Alas, my dear friend,¡± said Faria in a resigned tone, ¡°you understand,
do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?¡±

Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed
towards the door, exclaiming, ¡°Help, help!¡±

Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.

¡°Silence,¡± he said, ¡°or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my
dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your
flight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done
here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew
we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear
Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some
other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will
appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and
enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have
been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to
you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence has done
something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it
was time I should die.¡±

Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, ¡°Oh, my friend, my
friend, speak not thus!¡± and then resuming all his presence of mind,
which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,
which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, ¡°Oh, I have saved
you once, and I will save you a second time!¡± And raising the foot of
the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red
liquor.

¡°See,¡± he exclaimed, ¡°there remains still some of the magic draught.
Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh
instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.¡±

¡°There is not a hope,¡± replied Faria, shaking his head, ¡°but no matter;
God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so
profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to
preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always
so dear.¡±

¡°Oh, yes, yes!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s; ¡°and I tell you that I will save you
yet.¡±

¡°Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing
towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and
seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five
minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour
there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.¡±

¡°Oh!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s, his heart wrung with anguish.

¡°Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of life
are now exhausted in me, and death,¡± he continued, looking at his
paralyzed arm and leg, ¡°has but half its work to do. If, after having
made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not
recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I
can no longer support myself.¡±

Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.

¡°And now, my dear friend,¡± said Faria, ¡°sole consolation of my wretched
existence,¡ªyou whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a
priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,¡ªat the moment of
separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the
prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!¡±

The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the
old man¡¯s bed.

¡°Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the
Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or
space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the
inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much
riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abb¨¦, whom all the
world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo¡ªavail yourself of
the fortune¡ªfor you have indeed suffered long enough.¡±

A violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dant¨¨s raised his head and
saw Faria¡¯s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood
had ascended from the chest to the head.

¡°Adieu, adieu!¡± murmured the old man, clasping Edmond¡¯s hand
convulsively¡ª¡°adieu!¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡ªno, not yet,¡± he cried; ¡°do not forsake me! Oh, succor him!
Help¡ªhelp¡ªhelp!¡±

¡°Hush! hush!¡± murmured the dying man, ¡°that they may not separate us if
you save me!¡±

¡°You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,
although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you
were before.¡±

¡°Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to
endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth
to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ¡¯tis
here¡ª¡¯tis here¡ª¡¯tis over¡ªmy sight is gone¡ªmy senses fail! Your hand,
Dant¨¨s! Adieu! adieu!¡±

And raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his
faculties, he said,¡ª¡°Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!¡± And he fell
back on the bed.

The crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen
eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture,
in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.

Dant¨¨s took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,
whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the
distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze
he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.

When he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,
pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted
one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained,
perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an
hour, half an hour,¡ªno change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his
brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of
his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he
put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion
to force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole
of the liquid down his throat.

0255m


The draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the
old man¡¯s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them,
he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body
returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.

Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this
period of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to
his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart¡¯s
pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it
stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid,
the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed.

It was six o¡¯clock in the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and its
feeble ray came into the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of the
lamp. Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man, and
at times gave it the appearance of life. While the struggle between day
and night lasted, Dant¨¨s still doubted; but as soon as the daylight
gained the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then an
invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not again
press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze on those
fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but in
vain¡ªthey opened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp,
carefully concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could
the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.

It was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began his
rounds at Dant¨¨s¡¯ cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria¡¯s
dungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened that
the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.

Dant¨¨s was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was
going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore returned
by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the
exclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys
came, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all came
the governor.

Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the
voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead man¡¯s
face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did
not recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out, and
words of pity fell on Dant¨¨s¡¯ listening ears, mingled with brutal
laughter.

¡°Well, well,¡± said one, ¡°the madman has gone to look after his treasure.
Good journey to him!¡±

¡°With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!¡±
said another.

¡°Oh,¡± added a third voice, ¡°the shrouds of the Chateau d¡¯If are not
dear!¡±

0257m


¡°Perhaps,¡± said one of the previous speakers, ¡°as he was a churchman,
they may go to some expense in his behalf.¡±

¡°They may give him the honors of the sack.¡±

Edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was
said. The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had
left the cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some
turnkey to watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and motionless,
hardly venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he heard a faint
noise, which increased. It was the governor who returned, followed by
the doctor and other attendants. There was a moment¡¯s silence,¡ªit was
evident that the doctor was examining the dead body. The inquiries soon
commenced.

The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had
succumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers followed
in a nonchalant manner that made Dant¨¨s indignant, for he felt that all
the world should have for the poor abb¨¦ a love and respect equal to his
own.

¡°I am very sorry for what you tell me,¡± said the governor, replying to
the assurance of the doctor, ¡°that the old man is really dead; for he
was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no
watching.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± added the turnkey, ¡°there was no occasion for watching him; he
would have stayed here fifty years, I¡¯ll answer for it, without any
attempt to escape.¡±

¡°Still,¡± said the governor, ¡°I believe it will be requisite,
notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but
in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured
that the prisoner is dead.¡±

There was a moment of complete silence, during which Dant¨¨s, still
listening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.

¡°You may make your mind easy,¡± said the doctor; ¡°he is dead. I will
answer for that.¡±

¡°You know, sir,¡± said the governor, persisting, ¡°that we are not content
in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite of all
appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling
the formalities described by law.¡±

¡°Let the irons be heated,¡± said the doctor; ¡°but really it is a useless
precaution.¡±

This order to heat the irons made Dant¨¨s shudder. He heard hasty steps,
the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes
afterwards a turnkey entered, saying:

¡°Here is the brazier, lighted.¡±

There was a moment¡¯s silence, and then was heard the crackling of
burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even
behind the wall where Dant¨¨s was listening in horror. The perspiration
poured forth upon the young man¡¯s brow, and he felt as if he should
faint.

¡°You see, sir, he is really dead,¡± said the doctor; ¡°this burn in the
heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered
from his captivity.¡±

¡°Wasn¡¯t his name Faria?¡± inquired one of the officers who accompanied
the governor.

0259m


¡°Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very
learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his
treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.¡±

¡°It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,¡± said the doctor.

¡°You had never anything to complain of?¡± said the governor to the jailer
who had charge of the abb¨¦.

¡°Never, sir,¡± replied the jailer, ¡°never; on the contrary, he sometimes
amused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife
was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.¡±

¡°Ah, ah!¡± said the doctor, ¡°I did not know that I had a rival; but I
hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in
consequence.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the
newest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?¡±

¡°Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?¡± inquired a
turnkey.

¡°Certainly. But make haste¡ªI cannot stay here all day.¡± Other footsteps,
going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of
rustling canvas reached Dant¨¨s¡¯ ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy
footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed
again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.

¡°This evening,¡± said the governor.

¡°Will there be any mass?¡± asked one of the attendants.

¡°That is impossible,¡± replied the governor. ¡°The chaplain of the chateau
came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to take a
trip to Hy¨¨res for a week. I told him I would attend to the prisoners in
his absence. If the poor abb¨¦ had not been in such a hurry, he might
have had his requiem.¡±

¡°Pooh, pooh;¡± said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his
profession; ¡°he is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and not
give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.¡± A shout of
laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of putting
the body in the sack was going on.

¡°This evening,¡± said the governor, when the task was ended.

¡°At what hour?¡± inquired a turnkey.

¡°Why, about ten or eleven o¡¯clock.¡±

¡°Shall we watch by the corpse?¡±

¡°Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive¡ªthat is
all.¡±

Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the
noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a
silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,¡ªthe silence of death,
which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of
Dant¨¨s.

Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked
carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and Dant¨¨s emerged from the
tunnel.






Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Chateau d¡¯If

On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light
that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude
folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria¡¯s last
winding-sheet,¡ªa winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so
little. Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between
Dant¨¨s and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those wide-
open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no
longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his
existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion, with
whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed. He
seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into
melancholy and gloomy reverie.

Alone! he was alone again! again condemned to silence¡ªagain face to face
with nothingness! Alone!¡ªnever again to see the face, never again to
hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! Was not
Faria¡¯s fate the better, after all¡ªto solve the problem of life at its
source, even at the risk of horrible suffering?

The idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by
his cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abb¨¦¡¯s dead
body.

¡°If I could die,¡± he said, ¡°I should go where he goes, and should
assuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,¡± he went on
with a smile; ¡°I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens
the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.¡±

But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is
tossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dant¨¨s recoiled from the
idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an
ardent desire for life and liberty.

¡°Die? oh, no,¡± he exclaimed¡ª¡°not die now, after having lived and
suffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now to
die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I want
to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back the
happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not forget
that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who knows, some
friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I shall die in my
dungeon like Faria.¡±

As he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like one
overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,
lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or
thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.

¡°Just God!¡± he muttered, ¡°whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?
Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the
place of the dead!¡±

Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,
that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate
resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife
which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore it along
the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied around its
head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it with his
counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to
close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the head towards
the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the evening meal,
believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the
tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the other cell,
took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off his rags,
that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and
getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the dead
body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside.

He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any
mischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dant¨¨s might have
waited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the
governor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed
earlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.

Now his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If
while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that
they were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dant¨¨s did not intend
to give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,
he meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their
alarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to
better purpose.

0263m


If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow
himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the grave-
diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have
worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped that the
weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it. If
he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he would be
stifled, and then¡ªso much the better, all would be over.

Dant¨¨s had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not thought
of hunger, nor did he think of it now. His situation was too precarious
to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one.

The first risk that Dant¨¨s ran was, that the jailer, when he brought him
his supper at seven o¡¯clock, might perceive the change that had been
made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue,
Dant¨¨s had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread
and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word. This time
the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to Dant¨¨s, and
seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all.

When seven o¡¯clock came, Dant¨¨s¡¯ agony really began. His hand placed
upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the
other he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time
chills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of
ice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on
without any unusual disturbance, and Dant¨¨s knew that he had escaped the
first peril. It was a good augury.

At length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were
heard on the stairs. Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned
up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at the
same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins. The
footsteps¡ªthey were double¡ªpaused at the door¡ªand Dant¨¨s guessed that
the two grave-diggers had come to seek him¡ªthis idea was soon converted
into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the
hand-bier.

The door opened, and a dim light reached Dant¨¨s¡¯ eyes through the coarse
sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a third
remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. The two men, approaching
the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.

¡°He¡¯s heavy, though, for an old and thin man,¡± said one, as he raised
the head.

¡°They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,¡± said
another, lifting the feet.

¡°Have you tied the knot?¡± inquired the first speaker.

¡°What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?¡± was the reply,
¡°I can do that when we get there.¡±

¡°Yes, you¡¯re right,¡± replied the companion.

¡°What¡¯s the knot for?¡± thought Dant¨¨s.

They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened himself
in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by
the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs. Suddenly he
felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dant¨¨s knew that the mistral was
blowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely
mingled.

The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier
down on the ground. One of them went away, and Dant¨¨s heard his shoes
striking on the pavement.

¡°Where am I?¡± he asked himself.

¡°Really, he is by no means a light load!¡± said the other bearer, sitting
on the edge of the hand-barrow.

Dant¨¨s¡¯ first impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt
it.

¡°Give us a light,¡± said the other bearer, ¡°or I shall never find what I
am looking for.¡±

The man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite
terms.

¡°What can he be looking for?¡± thought Edmond. ¡°The spade, perhaps.¡±

An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found
the object of his search. ¡°Here it is at last,¡± he said, ¡°not without
some trouble, though.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± was the answer, ¡°but it has lost nothing by waiting.¡±

As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic
substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was
fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.

¡°Well, have you tied the knot?¡± inquired the grave-digger, who was
looking on.

¡°Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,¡± was the answer.

¡°Move on, then.¡± And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.

They advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door, then
went forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on
which the chateau is built, reached Dant¨¨s¡¯ ear distinctly as they went
forward.

¡°Bad weather!¡± observed one of the bearers; ¡°not a pleasant night for a
dip in the sea.¡±

¡°Why, yes, the abb¨¦ runs a chance of being wet,¡± said the other; and
then there was a burst of brutal laughter.

Dant¨¨s did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his
head.

¡°Well, here we are at last,¡± said one of them.

¡°A little farther¡ªa little farther,¡± said the other. ¡°You know very well
that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the
governor told us next day that we were careless fellows.¡±

They ascended five or six more steps, and then Dant¨¨s felt that they
took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to
and fro.

¡°One!¡± said the grave-diggers, ¡°two! three!¡±

And at the same instant Dant¨¨s felt himself flung into the air like a
wounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood
curdle. Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his
rapid descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century. At
last, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold
water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a moment by
his immersion beneath the waves.

Dant¨¨s had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by a
thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet.

The sea is the cemetery of the Chateau d¡¯If.

0267m







Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen

Dant¨¨s, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence
of mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was
for every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack,
extricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts
to free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still lower.
He then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the cord that
bound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually
strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while
the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become
his shroud.

Dant¨¨s waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid
being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where
he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across
which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling
star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and
terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a
storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose
phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed
like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a
torch lighting two figures.

He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these
strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dant¨¨s dived again, and
remained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him,
for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the
lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously
declared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the
light had disappeared.

He must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pom¨¨gue are the nearest
islands of all those that surround the Chateau d¡¯If, but Ratonneau and
Pom¨¨gue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and
Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dant¨¨s¡¯ venture. The islands of
Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Chateau d¡¯If; Dant¨¨s,
nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way
in the darkness of the night?

At this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him
like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of
Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he
would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the
Chateau d¡¯If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when
he saw him idle and inactive:

¡°Dant¨¨s, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned
if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised
and prepared for exertion.¡±

These words rang in Dant¨¨s¡¯ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to
cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He
found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his
power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he
had so often sported as a boy.

Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dant¨¨s¡¯ efforts. He listened for
any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top
of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he
redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the
chateau, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the
terrible chateau had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it,
but he felt its presence.

An hour passed, during which Dant¨¨s, excited by the feeling of freedom,
continued to cleave the waves.

¡°Let us see,¡± said he, ¡°I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is
against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I
must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?¡±

A shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest
himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make
use of this means of recuperation.

¡°Well,¡± said he, ¡°I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp
seizes me, and then I shall sink;¡± and he struck out with the energy of
despair.

Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense,
and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he
felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been
shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out
his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that
he had gained the shore.

Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so
much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent
combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dant¨¨s rose, advanced a few
steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the
granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the
wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.
At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder.
The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty
wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the
heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in
vast chaotic waves.

Dant¨¨s had not been deceived¡ªhe had reached the first of the two
islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and
without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to
plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but
larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.

An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he
availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves,
dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was
safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of
the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to
him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a
vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of
the storm.

He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty
hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that
had lodged in a hollow of the rock.

As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest
heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the
Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant,
Dant¨¨s saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power
of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with
frightful rapidity. Dant¨¨s cried at the top of his voice to warn them of
their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four
men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung
to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their
cries were carried to his ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a
sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it
gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast
sea-bird.

At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.
Dant¨¨s from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the
fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark
again.

Dant¨¨s ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces;
he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing¡ªthe cries had
ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the wind abated,
vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament
appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in
the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded
their foaming crests with gold. It was day.

Dant¨¨s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if
he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in
the Chateau d¡¯If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be
witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and
land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing
majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o¡¯clock. The
sea continued to get calmer.

¡°In two or three hours,¡± thought Dant¨¨s, ¡°the turnkey will enter my
chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in
vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men
who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will
be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the
wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a
man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be
on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold,
I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I
have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am
unable to do for myself.¡±

As Dant¨¨s (his eyes turned in the direction of the Chateau d¡¯If) uttered
this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pom¨¨gue a
small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of
prey; and with his sailor¡¯s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan. She
was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea
rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.

¡°Oh,¡± cried Edmond, ¡°to think that in half an hour I could join her, did
I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles!
What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of trading along
the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling
me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot¡ªI am starving. In a
few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have
not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors
wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no one left
to contradict me.¡±

As he spoke, Dant¨¨s looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had
been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a
point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel¡¯s
keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dant¨¨s¡¯ plan was
formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the
timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was
taking.

¡°I am saved!¡± murmured he. And this conviction restored his strength.

He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking
between the Chateau d¡¯If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he
feared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea;
but he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy,
between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne.

However, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and
in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of
him. He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on board
saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. Dant¨¨s would have
shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.

It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for
without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the
vessel¡ªcertainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in
attracting attention.

Dant¨¨s, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had
yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he
advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her
course. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his
cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was
both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At
the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.

An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards
him. Dant¨¨s let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,
and swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his
strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to
him. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was
almost breathless.

He shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of
them cried in Italian, ¡°Courage!¡±

The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength
to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface,
struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a
third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were
again tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky
turned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He
felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had
fainted.

When he opened his eyes Dant¨¨s found himself on the deck of the tartan.
His first care was to see what course they were taking. They were
rapidly leaving the Chateau d¡¯If behind. Dant¨¨s was so exhausted that
the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.

As we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his
limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who
had cried out ¡°Courage!¡± held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while
the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with
that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped
yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.

A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction
of his limbs restored their elasticity.

¡°Who are you?¡± said the pilot in bad French.

¡°I am,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, in bad Italian, ¡°a Maltese sailor. We were
coming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook
us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.¡±

¡°Where do you come from?¡±

¡°From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain
and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and fearful
of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a piece of
wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my life, and I
thank you,¡± continued Dant¨¨s. ¡°I was lost when one of your sailors
caught hold of my hair.¡±

¡°It was I,¡± said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; ¡°and it was
time, for you were sinking.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± returned Dant¨¨s, holding out his hand, ¡°I thank you again.¡±

¡°I almost hesitated, though,¡± replied the sailor; ¡°you looked more like
a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair
a foot long.¡±

Dant¨¨s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time
he was at the Chateau d¡¯If.

¡°Yes,¡± said he, ¡°I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my
hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but
today the vow expires.¡±

¡°Now what are we to do with you?¡± said the captain.

¡°Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped;
but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be
sure to find employment.¡±

¡°Do you know the Mediterranean?¡±

¡°I have sailed over it since my childhood.¡±

¡°You know the best harbors?¡±

¡°There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over
my eyes.¡±

¡°I say, captain,¡± said the sailor who had cried ¡°Courage!¡± to Dant¨¨s,
¡°if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?¡±

¡°If he says true,¡± said the captain doubtingly. ¡°But in his present
condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it
afterwards.¡±

¡°I will do more than I promise,¡± said Dant¨¨s.

¡°We shall see,¡± returned the other, smiling.

¡°Where are you going?¡± asked Dant¨¨s.

¡°To Leghorn.¡±

¡°Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the
wind?¡±

¡°Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.¡±

¡°You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.¡±

¡°Take the helm, and let us see what you know.¡±

The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the
rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she
yet was tolerably obedient.

¡°To the sheets,¡± said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew,
obeyed, while the pilot looked on. ¡°Haul taut.¡±

They obeyed.

¡°Belay.¡± This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dant¨¨s
had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.

¡°Bravo!¡± said the captain.

¡°Bravo!¡± repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at
this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor
they had not thought him capable of showing.

¡°You see,¡± said Dant¨¨s, quitting the helm, ¡°I shall be of some use to
you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you
can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for
my food and the clothes you lend me.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the captain, ¡°we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.¡±

¡°Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,¡± returned
Dant¨¨s.

¡°That¡¯s not fair,¡± said the seaman who had saved Dant¨¨s; ¡°for you know
more than we do.¡±

¡°What is that to you, Jacopo?¡± returned the Captain. ¡°Everyone is free
to ask what he pleases.¡±

¡°That¡¯s true,¡± replied Jacopo; ¡°I only make a remark.¡±

¡°Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of
trousers, if you have them.¡±

¡°No,¡± said Jacopo; ¡°but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.¡±

¡°That is all I want,¡± interrupted Dant¨¨s. Jacopo dived into the hold and
soon returned with what Edmond wanted.

¡°Now, then, do you wish for anything else?¡± said the patron.

¡°A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I
have not eaten or drunk for a long time.¡± He had not tasted food for
forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the
gourd.

¡°Larboard your helm,¡± cried the captain to the steersman. Dant¨¨s glanced
that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in
mid-air.

¡°Hollo! what¡¯s the matter at the Chateau d¡¯If?¡± said the captain.

A small white cloud, which had attracted Dant¨¨s¡¯ attention, crowned the
summit of the bastion of the Chateau d¡¯If. At the same moment the faint
report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.

¡°What is this?¡± asked the captain.

¡°A prisoner has escaped from the Chateau d¡¯If, and they are firing the
alarm gun,¡± replied Dant¨¨s. The captain glanced at him, but he had
lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure,
that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.

0277m


¡°Pretty strong rum! ¡° said Dant¨¨s, wiping his brow with his sleeve.

¡°At any rate,¡± murmured he, ¡°if it be, so much the better, for I have
made a rare acquisition.¡±

0279m


Under pretence of being fatigued, Dant¨¨s asked to take the helm; the
steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by
a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dant¨¨s
could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.

¡°What is the day of the month?¡± asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside
him.

¡°The 28th of February.¡±

¡°In what year?¡±

¡°In what year¡ªyou ask me in what year?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied the young man, ¡°I ask you in what year!¡±

¡°You have forgotten then?¡±

¡°I got such a fright last night,¡± replied Dant¨¨s, smiling, ¡°that I have
almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?¡±

¡°The year 1829,¡± returned Jacopo.

It was fourteen years, day for day, since Dant¨¨s¡¯ arrest. He was
nineteen when he entered the Chateau d¡¯If; he was thirty-three when he
escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what
had become of Merc¨¦d¨¨s, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted
up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long
and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and
Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.

This oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the
Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that
with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn.






Chapter 22. The Smugglers

Dant¨¨s had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of
the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the
school of the Abb¨¦ Faria, the worthy master of La Jeune Am¨¦lie (the name
of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on
the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic
to the Proven?al, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons
always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities
of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small
boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country,
or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who
live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct
gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair
to assume that Dant¨¨s was on board a smuggler.

At first the captain had received Dant¨¨s on board with a certain degree
of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the
coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual
battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dant¨¨s might be an emissary
of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps
employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his
trade. But the skilful manner in which Dant¨¨s had handled the lugger had
entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke
floating above the bastion of the Chateau d¡¯If, and heard the distant
report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his
vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied
with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned,
than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this
supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect
tranquillity of his recruit.

Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the
owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried
to ¡°pump¡± him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate
descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles,
and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was,
was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical
skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is
possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know
nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they
should believe.

In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond
was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could
recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years.
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had
been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades
believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at
Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there
to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this
man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head
the appearance of one of Titian¡¯s portraits. At this period it was not
the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber
would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should
consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said
nothing and went to work.

When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was
completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked
for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years
of age, and his fourteen years¡¯ imprisonment had produced a great
transformation in his appearance.

Dant¨¨s had entered the Chateau d¡¯If with the round, open, smiling face
of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been
smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This
was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had
assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows
were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of
melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of
misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had
now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with
black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the
profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features
a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being
naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which
has so long concentrated all its force within itself.

0283m


To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity
of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and
imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly
penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.

Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had
acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to
the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was
impossible that his best friend¡ªif, indeed, he had any friend left¡ªcould
recognize him; he could not recognize himself.

The master of La Jeune Am¨¦lie, who was very desirous of retaining
amongst his crew a man of Edmond¡¯s value, had offered to advance him
funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next
care on leaving the barber¡¯s who had achieved his first metamorphosis
was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor¡¯s suit¡ªa garb, as we all
know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,
and a cap.

It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and
trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of
the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before
he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man
with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking
in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. Attracted
by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement
to Dant¨¨s; but Dant¨¨s, who had his own projects, would not agree for a
longer time than three months.

La Jeune Am¨¦lie had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain,
who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at
Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins,
contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had
forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn
free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain
speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France.

They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the
first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in
prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and
went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon.

The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the
patron found Dant¨¨s leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense
earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged with
rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo.

La Jeune Am¨¦lie left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and
kept on for Corsica. Dant¨¨s thought, as they passed so closely to the
island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap
into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then what
could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms
to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the
patron think? He must wait.

Fortunately, Dant¨¨s had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen
years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six
months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without
riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches
chimerical?¡ªoffspring of the brain of the poor Abb¨¦ Faria, had they not
died with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was
singularly circumstantial, and Dant¨¨s repeated it to himself, from one
end to the other, for he had not forgotten a word.

0285m


Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of
twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own,
for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to
behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn
broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening
saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal
for landing, for a ship¡¯s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead
of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dant¨¨s
noticed that the captain of La Jeune Am¨¦lie had, as he neared the land,
mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can throw
a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.

But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything
proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came
off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in
acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea,
and the five boats worked so well that by two o¡¯clock in the morning all
the cargo was out of La Jeune Am¨¦lie and on terra firma. The same night,
such a man of regularity was the patron of La Jeune Am¨¦lie, the profits
were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres, or about eighty
francs.

But the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia,
where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace what had
been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the first, La
Jeune Am¨¦lie was in luck. This new cargo was destined for the coast of
the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars,
sherry, and Malaga wines.

There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the
excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of La Jeune
Am¨¦lie. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dant¨¨s
was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder.
Dant¨¨s was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being
wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he
could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He
had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed
with the great philosopher, ¡°Pain, thou art not an evil.¡±

He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and,
whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of
human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.
Dant¨¨s was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the
end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in
his bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing
towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the
kindness of a devoted comrade.

This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither
was it so wicked as Dant¨¨s thought it, since this man, who had nothing
to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the
prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.
Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain
herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old
Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try
Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his
prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.

As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first
bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of
affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that
Edmond had a right to superiority of position¡ªa superiority which Edmond
had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which
Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.

Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with
security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the
helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,
with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor
Abb¨¦ Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the
coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to
read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and
where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.

And when Jacopo inquired of him, ¡°What is the use of teaching all these
things to a poor sailor like me?¡± Edmond replied, ¡°Who knows? You may
one day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte,
became emperor.¡± We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.

Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as
skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an
acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the
Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had
passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not
once had he found an opportunity of landing there.

He then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron
of La Jeune Am¨¦lie ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own
account¡ªfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres¡ªand
under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo. Then he would be
free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at liberty, for he
would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him. But in this
world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was
desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain did he rack his
imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any plan for
reaching the island without companionship.

Dant¨¨s was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who
had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in
his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on
the Via del¡¯ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to
congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already
Dant¨¨s had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing
all these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly
two hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might not
that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these
contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was
under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets,
stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some
neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and
land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was successful
the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty
piastres each for the crew.

The patron of La Jeune Am¨¦lie proposed as a place of landing the Island
of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither
soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst
of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god
of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times
have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have
included in the same category.

At the mention of Monte Cristo Dant¨¨s started with joy; he rose to
conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all
the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca.

When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter,
it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out
on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the
island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to
be well done should be done quickly.

Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under
weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral
island by the following day.

Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo

Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which
sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an
evil destiny, Dant¨¨s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for,
by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring
any suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way.

The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions,
good and evil, passed through Dant¨¨s¡¯ mind. If he closed his eyes, he
saw Cardinal Spada¡¯s letter written on the wall in characters of
flame¡ªif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He
ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and
the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as
subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck,
filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight,
when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles.
He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had
suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the
entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and
mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the
Arabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had
again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry
it off.

The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had
been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dant¨¨s was
then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and
unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for
departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dant¨¨s¡¯ agitation.
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was
almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear,
distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity
and pleasure.

The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the
superiority of Dant¨¨s over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man
his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he
might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven
o¡¯clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they
doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm,
and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a
bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights,
each of which is a world. Dant¨¨s told them that all hands might turn in,
and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dant¨¨s)
had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks
contentedly.

This frequently happened. Dant¨¨s, cast from solitude into the world,
frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what
solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship
floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in
the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?

Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up by
his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When the
patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and every
sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an hour.
The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond resigned
the lugger to the master¡¯s care, and went and lay down in his hammock;
but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a
moment.

Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double
the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the
flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo reddened
by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dant¨¨s ordered the
helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to
starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three
knots. About five o¡¯clock in the evening the island was distinct, and
everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the
atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its
setting.

Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the
variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue;
and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist
passed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune is
staked on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond felt
in his paroxysms of hope.

Night came, and at ten o¡¯clock they anchored. La Jeune Am¨¦lie was first
at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual command over himself, Dant¨¨s
could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on shore;
and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have ¡°kissed his mother
earth.¡± It was dark, but at eleven o¡¯clock the moon rose in the midst of
the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, ¡°ascending high,¡±
played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.

The island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Am¨¦lie,¡ªit was one of
her regular haunts. As to Dant¨¨s, he had passed it on his voyage to and
from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.

¡°Where shall we pass the night?¡± he inquired.

¡°Why, on board the tartan,¡± replied the sailor.

¡°Should we not do better in the grottos?¡±

¡°What grottos?¡±

¡°Why, the grottos¡ªcaves of the island.¡±

¡°I do not know of any grottos,¡± replied Jacopo.

The cold sweat sprang forth on Dant¨¨s¡¯ brow.

¡°What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?¡± he asked.

¡°None.¡±

For a moment Dant¨¨s was speechless; then he remembered that these caves
might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the
sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to
discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and
Dant¨¨s therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a
signal made half a league out at sea, and to which La Jeune Am¨¦lie
replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had
come.

The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was
well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor
within a cable¡¯s length of shore.

Then the landing began. Dant¨¨s reflected, as he worked, on the shout of
joy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he
gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart;
but, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he
had already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual
questions, his minute observations and evident preoccupation, aroused
suspicions. Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his
painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the
glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but
transitory.

No one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a fowling-
piece, powder, and shot, Dant¨¨s declared his intention to go and kill
some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock, his
wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for solitude.
However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dant¨¨s did not oppose
this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. Scarcely,
however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid,
he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook
it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This and some dried
fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of fare.

Dant¨¨s went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him.
Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath
him, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy
preparing the repast which Edmond¡¯s skill as a marksman had augmented
with a capital dish.

Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a
man superior to his fellows.

¡°In two hours¡¯ time,¡± said he, ¡°these persons will depart richer by
fifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to
gain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred
francs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans
and the insolence of nabobs. At this moment hope makes me despise their
riches, which seem to me contemptible. Yet perchance tomorrow deception
will so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a
contemptible possession as the utmost happiness. Oh, no!¡± exclaimed
Edmond, ¡°that will not be. The wise, unerring Faria could not be
mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it were better to die than to
continue to lead this low and wretched life.¡±

Thus Dant¨¨s, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had
now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in
Dant¨¨s, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has
filled him with boundless desires.

Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn
by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never
before trod, Dant¨¨s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos
must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest
object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain
rocks, marks made by the hand of man.

Time, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as
it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have
respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree
of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the
marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes
laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to
separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-
marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it
not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order
that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a
catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete.
This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man
desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have
attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the
dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?

0295m


It seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the
inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the
marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock,
placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to
lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of
the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned
round and retraced his steps.

Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from
a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at
the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they
saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock,
and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed
his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched
his daring progress, Edmond¡¯s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on
the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all
loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.

He found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had
rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little
rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial
to him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened his eyes,
complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his
head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the
shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo¡¯s directions, he
declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.

It may be supposed that Dant¨¨s did not now think of his dinner, but he
insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should
have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a
little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The
sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of
the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious.
An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do
was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-
grown rock.

But, instead of growing easier, Dant¨¨s¡¯ pains appeared to increase in
violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in
order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between
Nice and Fr¨¦jus, urged Dant¨¨s to try and rise. Edmond made great
exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning
and turning pale.

¡°He has broken his ribs,¡± said the commander, in a low voice. ¡°No
matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will
try and carry him on board the tartan.¡±

Dant¨¨s declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than
undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.

¡°Well,¡± said the patron, ¡°let what may happen, it shall never be said
that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.¡±

This very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The
patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him
give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dant¨¨s would not
allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be
made in his favor.

¡°No, no,¡± he said to the patron, ¡°I was awkward, and it is just that I
pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a
gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a
pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.¡±

¡°But you¡¯ll die of hunger,¡± said the patron.

¡°I would rather do so,¡± was Edmond¡¯s reply, ¡°than suffer the
inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.¡±

The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in
the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea
when her toilet should be completed.

¡°What are we to do, Maltese?¡± asked the captain. ¡°We cannot leave you
here so, and yet we cannot stay.¡±

¡°Go, go!¡± exclaimed Dant¨¨s.

¡°We shall be absent at least a week,¡± said the patron, ¡°and then we must
run out of our course to come here and take you up again.¡±

¡°Why,¡± said Dant¨¨s, ¡°if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat,
desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my
passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.¡±
The patron shook his head.

¡°Listen, Captain Baldi; there¡¯s one way of settling this,¡± said Jacopo.
¡°Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.¡±

¡°And give up your share of the venture,¡± said Edmond, ¡°to remain with
me?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Jacopo, ¡°and without any hesitation.¡±

¡°You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,¡± replied Edmond,
¡°and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do
not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up,
and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for
bruises.¡±

A peculiar smile passed over Dant¨¨s¡¯ lips; he squeezed Jacopo¡¯s hand
warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain¡ªand remain
alone.

The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but
not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a
cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if he
could not move the rest of his body.

Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,¡ª¡°¡¯Tis strange
that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and
devotion.¡± Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from
which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan
complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing
herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set
sail.

At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was
impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where
he was. Then Dant¨¨s rose more agile and light than the kid among the
myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his
pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the marks
he had noted terminated.

¡°And now,¡± he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman,
which Faria had related to him, ¡°now, Open Sesame!¡±






Chapter 24. The Secret Cave

The sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell
full on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.
Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a
monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved
and rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the
lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the
wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island was
inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of God.

He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread¡ªthat dread of
the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and
observed. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was
about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his
gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed
round in every direction.

But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could
distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its
historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to
the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the
proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the
brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just
set sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.

The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other,
following an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of
Corsica.

This sight reassured him. He then looked at the objects near him. He saw
that he was on the highest point of the island,¡ªa statue on this vast
pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the blue
ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a fringe
of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded
lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should
happen in reality.

Dant¨¨s, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he
had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the
bath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its
mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small
vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from
observation.

Then following the clew that, in the hands of the Abb¨¦ Faria, had been
so skilfully used to guide him through the D?dalian labyrinth of
probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be
watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed
the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had
buried his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dant¨¨s back to
the circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his
theory. How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been
lifted to this spot, without the aid of many men?

Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind. Instead of raising it, thought
he, they have lowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order to
inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.

He soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid
along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large stone
had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it,
so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered
with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the
stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to
the earth.

0301m


Dant¨¨s dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he
detected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by the
hand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes¡¯ labor the wall gave
way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.

Dant¨¨s went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off
its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But the
rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man,
were he Hercules himself. Dant¨¨s saw that he must attack the wedge. But
how?

He cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his
friend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would
serve him for this purpose.

With the aid of his pickaxe, Dant¨¨s, after the manner of a labor-saving
pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported
it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his handkerchief
in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired.

The explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by
the terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces;
thousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dant¨¨s had previously
formed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure,
rolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.

Dant¨¨s approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned
towards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it, and,
selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack,
placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every nerve to
move the mass.

The rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base. Dant¨¨s
redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who
uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods. The rock
yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally
disappeared in the ocean.

On the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring
let into a square flag-stone.

Dant¨¨s uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt been
crowned with more perfect success. He would fain have continued, but his
knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight became so
dim, that he was forced to pause.

This feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the
ring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed
steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a
subterraneous grotto.

Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy. Dant¨¨s turned pale,
hesitated, and reflected.

¡°Come,¡± said he to himself, ¡°be a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I
must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived. What,
then, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when,
after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions
destroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure
here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, C?sar Borgia, the
intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has
followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised
the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.¡±

He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy
aperture that was open at his feet.

¡°Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest
hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.¡±
And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.

¡°Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of
that royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain
of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in
the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps
two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as
I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring
progress.¡±

0303m


¡°But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?¡±
asked Dant¨¨s of himself.

¡°The fate,¡± replied he, smiling, ¡°of those who buried Alaric, and were
interred with the corpse.¡±

¡°Yet, had he come,¡± thought Dant¨¨s, ¡°he would have found the treasure,
and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour
leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing
this rock. I will go down.¡±

Then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of
human philosophy, ¡°Perhaps!¡±

But instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he
had expected to find, Dant¨¨s saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well
as the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but
by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from
without, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the
waving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers
that grew from the rocks.

After having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which
was rather warm than damp, Dant¨¨s¡¯ eye, habituated as it was to
darkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which
was of granite that sparkled like diamonds.

¡°Alas,¡± said Edmond, smiling, ¡°these are the treasures the cardinal has
left; and the good abb¨¦, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has
indulged in fallacious hopes.¡±

But he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart. ¡°In
the farthest angle of the second opening,¡± said the cardinal¡¯s will. He
had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second. Dant¨¨s
continued his search. He reflected that this second grotto must
penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded
one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for
precaution¡¯s sake.

The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of
Dant¨¨s¡¯ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him
that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he
eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a
prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must
be.

However, he, like C?sar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to
avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe,
struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that
appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the
consoling sound he had before heard.

He again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing
occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used
in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in
flakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been
closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to
imitate granite. Dant¨¨s struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which
entered someway between the interstices.

It was there he must dig.

But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that
Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give way,
and a feeling of discouragement stole over him. This last proof, instead
of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended,
or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his
brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a
desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in reality
because he felt that he was about to faint.

The island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery
glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the
blue ocean.

Dant¨¨s had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a
moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the
cavern.

The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his
grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. After several blows he
perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed
one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of
his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the
stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.

He had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to
draw the stones towards him one by one. The aperture was already
sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still
cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after
renewed hesitation, Dant¨¨s entered the second grotto.

The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that
could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell
Dant¨¨s was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited in order
to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.

At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dant¨¨s¡¯ eye
there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was,
like the first, empty.

The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at
length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dant¨¨s¡¯ fate would be
decided.

He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution,
attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the
pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell, never
did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had Dant¨¨s found
nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.

He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same
resistance, but not the same sound.

¡°It is a casket of wood bound with iron,¡± thought he.

At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dant¨¨s seized
his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A wild goat
had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little
distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his
dinner; but Dant¨¨s feared lest the report of his gun should attract
attention.

He thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the
fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended
with this torch.

He wished to see everything. He approached the hole he had dug, and now,
with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck
against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground and resumed
his labor.

In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared, and
Dant¨¨s could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut steel; in the middle of
the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was still untarnished,
the arms of the Spada family¡ªviz., a sword, en pale, on an oval shield,
like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmounted by a cardinal¡¯s
hat.

Dant¨¨s easily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.
There was no longer any doubt: the treasure was there¡ªno one would have
been at such pains to conceal an empty casket. In an instant he had
cleared every obstacle away, and he saw successively the lock, placed
between two padlocks, and the two handles at each end, all carved as
things were carved at that epoch, when art rendered the commonest metals
precious.

Dant¨¨s seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was
impossible. He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these
faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust. Dant¨¨s
inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid,
and pressing with all his force on the handle, burst open the
fastenings. The hinges yielded in their turn and fell, still holding in
their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.

0307m


Edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside
him. He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see
in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are
visible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless
with amazement.

Three compartments divided the coffer. In the first, blazed piles of
golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold, which
possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, Edmond
grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell on
one another, sounded like hail against glass.

After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed
through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock,
from whence he could behold the sea. He was alone¡ªalone with these
countless, these unheard-of treasures! Was he awake, or was it but a
dream? Was it a transient vision, or was he face to face with reality?

He would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength
enough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent
his senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of
Monte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with
his wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to
believe the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found
himself before this mine of gold and jewels.

This time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively,
uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone. He soon became calmer and
more happy, for only now did he begin to realize his felicity.

He then set himself to work to count his fortune. There were a thousand
ingots of gold, each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up
twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our
money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors;
and he saw that the complement was not half empty. And he measured ten
double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which,
mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their intrinsic
worth.

Dant¨¨s saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in
the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and a small
quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours¡¯ sleep,
lying over the mouth of the cave.

It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous
emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.






Chapter 25. The Unknown

Day, for which Dant¨¨s had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open
eyes, again dawned. With the first light Dant¨¨s resumed his search.
Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening,
and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but
it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the
morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of
eve.

Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with
gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled
fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then
carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform
appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on
it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite,
filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted
rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn,
then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced
every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-
looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he impatiently
awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte Cristo for the
purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches
that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of
his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among mankind, and to assume
the rank, power, and influence which are always accorded to wealth¡ªthat
first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man.

On the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dant¨¨s
recognized the rig and handling of La Jeune Am¨¦lie, and dragging himself
with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his
companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than
when they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident.
He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the
smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in
safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a
guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail
towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to
evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dant¨¨s, whose
superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so
materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when,
fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of
Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit. Upon the whole, however, the
trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while
the crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dant¨¨s
had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which
amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each.

0311m


Edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the
faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all
the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island;
but as La Jeune Am¨¦lie had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him
away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to
Leghorn.

Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in
precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds
for five thousand francs each. Dant¨¨s half feared that such valuable
jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite
suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions
concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least
eighty per cent.

The following day Dant¨¨s presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel,
accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he
might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his
outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the
purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dant¨¨s, residing in
the All¨¦es de Meilhan, and also a young woman called Merc¨¦d¨¨s, an
inhabitant of the Catalan village.

Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent
present, which Dant¨¨s hastened to account for by saying that he had
merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did
not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his
arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left
him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of
Dant¨¨s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it
never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy.

The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board La Jeune Am¨¦lie
having expired, Dant¨¨s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all
his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but
having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him
further.

The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions
from Dant¨¨s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo.

Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dant¨¨s proceeded to make
his final adieus on board La Jeune Am¨¦lie, distributing so liberal a
gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and
expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the
captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his
future plans. Then Dant¨¨s departed for Genoa.

At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay;
this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard
that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the
Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous
of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between
the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.
Dant¨¨s, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel,
applied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand
francs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate
possession. The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so
as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour
through Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks
or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to
complete another. A bargain was therefore struck. Dant¨¨s led the owner
of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few
minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted
out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold
pieces.

The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable
crew for the little vessel, but this Dant¨¨s declined with many thanks,
saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal
pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the
builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet
in the cabin at his bed¡¯s head, the closet to contain three divisions,
so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The builder
cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret
places completed by the next day, Dant¨¨s furnishing the dimensions and
plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.

0313m


Two hours afterward Dant¨¨s sailed from the port of Genoa, under the
inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the
rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their
wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with
which Dant¨¨s handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated
with almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest
touch; and Dant¨¨s required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to
acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high
reputation in the art of shipbuilding.

The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it
remained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable
destination. Some insisted she was making for Corsica, others the Island
of Elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain;
while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended
course; but no one thought of Monte Cristo.

Yet thither it was that Dant¨¨s guided his vessel, and at Monte Cristo he
arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself a
first-class sailor, and had come the distance from Genoa in thirty-five
hours. Dant¨¨s had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore,
and, instead of landing at the usual place, he dropped anchor in the
little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and bore no evidence of
having been visited since he went away; his treasure was just as he had
left it.

Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches,
and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited
in the compartments of the secret locker.

A week passed by. Dant¨¨s employed it in man?uvring his yacht round the
island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined
for some important service, till at the end of that time he was
perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former Dant¨¨s
proposed to augment, the latter to remedy.

Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail
approaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat
he had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was
returned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside
the yacht.

A mournful answer awaited each of Edmond¡¯s eager inquiries as to the
information Jacopo had obtained. Old Dant¨¨s was dead, and Merc¨¦d¨¨s had
disappeared.

Dant¨¨s listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but,
leaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite alone. In a
couple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopo¡¯s boat came on
board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she
should be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father¡¯s death he was in
some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious
disappearance of Merc¨¦d¨¨s.

Without divulging his secret, Dant¨¨s could not give sufficiently clear
instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was
desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could
investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had
assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of
recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he
thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the
little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored
exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten
night of his departure for the Chateau d¡¯If, he had been put on board
the boat destined to convey him thither.

0315m


Still Dant¨¨s could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme
who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere
the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with
that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance
with Faria, Dant¨¨s coolly presented an English passport he had obtained
from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport
would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle
to his immediate debarkation.

The first person to attract the attention of Dant¨¨s, as he landed on the
Canebi¨¨re, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon. Edmond welcomed
the meeting with this fellow¡ªwho had been one of his own sailors¡ªas a
sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in
his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety
of questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man¡¯s
countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the
slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was
then conversing.

Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, Dant¨¨s
proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man
loudly calling him to stop.

Dant¨¨s instantly turned to meet him.

¡°I beg your pardon, sir,¡± said the honest fellow, in almost breathless
haste, ¡°but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a two-
franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.¡±

¡°Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake,
as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another
double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask
your messmates to join you.¡±

So extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to
thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in
speechless astonishment. ¡°Some nabob from India,¡± was his comment.

Dant¨¨s, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his
heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections
were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled
with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he
arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of
the All¨¦es de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond
and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees
tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung
for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the
ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing
there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his
brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the
house in which his father had lived.

The nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to
train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the
house.

Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper
stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and
asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the
negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the
fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the
concierge that they were occupied, Dant¨¨s succeeded in inducing the man
to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be
allowed to look at them.

The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been
scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dant¨¨s sighed heavily. Nothing
in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been
in the time of the elder Dant¨¨s; the very paper was different, while the
articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in
Edmond¡¯s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he
had left them.

The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former
owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of
his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as
he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly
calling for his son.

The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor¡¯s
emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other
down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the
sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to
its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge
his sorrow alone.

0317m


When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both
accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come
again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling
would ever be open to him.

As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire
whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for
reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the
present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.

Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the
All¨¦es de Meilhan belonged, Dant¨¨s next proceeded thither, and, under
the name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport),
purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs,
at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked
half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been given.

The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of
the house, now become the property of Dant¨¨s, were duly informed by the
notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the
new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house,
without the least augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving
instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited.

This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the
neighborhood of the All¨¦es de Meilhan, and a multitude of theories were
afloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth. But what raised
public astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance, was
the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the
All¨¦es de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little
village of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor
fisherman¡¯s hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after
persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or
sixteen years.

But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had
been asked received a handsome present, consisting of an entirely new
fishing-boat, with two seines and a tender.

The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have
poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen
him, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and
then springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte
d¡¯Aix.






Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn

Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of
France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of
Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,¡ªa little nearer to the former
than to the latter,¡ªa small roadside inn, from the front of which hung,
creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a
grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of
entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed
upon the Rh?ne. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden,
consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main
entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and
stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty
foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these
sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots;
while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised
its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and
displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by
the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.

All these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which
the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others being
the Durance and the Parliament.

In the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid
ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no
doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the
country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those
parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a
grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene
with its strident, monotonous note.

For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man
and his wife, with two servants,¡ªa chambermaid named Trinette, and a
hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the
requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had
revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the
stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this
prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter
ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rh?ne from
which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred
steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful
description.

The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of
age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those
southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked
nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like
his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in
spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.
His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown
from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself
from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for
guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to
the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his
head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the
Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard
Caderousse.

His wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle,
was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood of Arles,
she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but
that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of
the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes
and the marshes of Camargue. She remained nearly always in her second-
floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble
on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door¡ªa duty he
performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the
necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his
helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives
against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an
unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:

¡°Hush, La Carconte. It is God¡¯s pleasure that things should be so.¡±

The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from
the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated
between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants
of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by
some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on
her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of
Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would
not have enabled him to pronounce.

Still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the
will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the
double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and
his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner¡¯s murmurs
and lamentations.

0323m


Like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and
moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to
display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place
without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the
picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the
south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by
the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming
fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed
equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains,
necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests,
elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the
shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad
in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the
pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling
of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry
music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to
which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.

Caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the
door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven
grass¡ªon which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly,
endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate¡ªto
the deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was
aroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he
went, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the
entrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who
might be passing.

At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,
the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely
as a desert at midday. There it lay stretching out into one interminable
line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees,
altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his
senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate
his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a
formidable Sahara.

Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer,
he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the
direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would
easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom
the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist. The horse
was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace. His rider was
a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite
of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree
of rapidity.

Having arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether
for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to
say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his
steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure
him. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen
door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton
handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed
from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end
of his iron-shod stick.

At this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring
assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his
sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how
little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy footstep was
heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor,
and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard
besought his guest to enter.

0319m


¡°You are welcome, sir, most welcome!¡± repeated the astonished
Caderousse. ¡°Now, then, Margotin,¡± cried he, speaking to the dog, ¡°will
you be quiet? Pray don¡¯t heed him, sir!¡ªhe only barks, he never bites. I
make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully
hot day.¡± Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller
he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: ¡°A thousand pardons!
I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor
roof. What would the abb¨¦ please to have? What refreshment can I offer?
All I have is at his service.¡±

The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
gaze¡ªthere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the
countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at
his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed
it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking
with a strong Italian accent, ¡°You are, I presume, M. Caderousse?¡±

¡°Yes, sir,¡± answered the host, even more surprised at the question than
he had been by the silence which had preceded it; ¡°I am Gaspard
Caderousse, at your service.¡±

¡°Gaspard Caderousse,¡± rejoined the priest. ¡°Yes,¡ªChristian and surname
are the same. You formerly lived, I believe in the All¨¦es de Meilhan, on
the fourth floor?¡±

0325m


¡°I did.¡±

¡°And you followed the business of a tailor?¡±

¡°True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at
Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will
in time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there
nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?¡±

¡°Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your
permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.¡±

¡°As you please, sir,¡± said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the
present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of
Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in
the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and
kitchen.

Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of
five minutes, he found the abb¨¦ seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his
elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the
unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him,
and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his
long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed
earnestly on the traveller¡¯s face.

¡°Are you quite alone?¡± inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before
him the bottle of wine and a glass.

¡°Quite, quite alone,¡± replied the man¡ª¡°or, at least, practically so, for
my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is
laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor
thing!¡±

¡°You are married, then?¡± said the priest, with a show of interest,
glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.

¡°Ah, sir,¡± said Caderousse with a sigh, ¡°it is easy to perceive I am not
a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being
honest.¡± The abb¨¦ fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.

¡°Yes, honest¡ªI can certainly say that much for myself,¡± continued the
innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abb¨¦¡¯s gaze; ¡°I can
boast with truth of being an honest man; and,¡± continued he
significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, ¡°that is
more than everyone can say nowadays.¡±

0327m


¡°So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,¡± said the abb¨¦;
¡°for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be
rewarded, and the wicked punished.¡±

¡°Such words as those belong to your profession,¡± answered Caderousse,
¡°and you do well to repeat them; but,¡± added he, with a bitter
expression of countenance, ¡°one is free to believe them or not, as one
pleases.¡±

¡°You are wrong to speak thus,¡± said the abb¨¦; ¡°and perhaps I may, in my
own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.¡±

¡°What mean you?¡± inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.

¡°In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in
search of.¡±

¡°What proofs do you require?¡±

¡°Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor
named Dant¨¨s?¡±

¡°Dant¨¨s? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dant¨¨s and myself were
intimate friends!¡± exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed
darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb¨¦ fixed on him, while
the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish
scrutiny.

¡°You remind me,¡± said the priest, ¡°that the young man concerning whom I
asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.¡±

¡°Said to bear the name!¡± repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and
eager. ¡°Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation
of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor
Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous
and happy?¡±

¡°He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the
felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.¡±

A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who
turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with
the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.

¡°Poor fellow, poor fellow!¡± murmured Caderousse. ¡°Well, there, sir, is
another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and
that none but the wicked prosper. Ah,¡± continued Caderousse, speaking in
the highly colored language of the South, ¡°the world grows worse and
worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to
do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?¡±

¡°You speak as though you had loved this young Dant¨¨s,¡± observed the
abb¨¦, without taking any notice of his companion¡¯s vehemence.

¡°And so I did,¡± replied Caderousse; ¡°though once, I confess, I envied
him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by
everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely
lamented his unhappy fate.¡±

There was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the
abb¨¦ was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the
innkeeper.

¡°You knew the poor lad, then?¡± continued Caderousse.

¡°I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to
him the consolations of religion.¡±

¡°And of what did he die?¡± asked Caderousse in a choking voice.

¡°Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they
have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of
imprisonment?¡± Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration
that gathered on his brow.

0329m


¡°But the strangest part of the story is,¡± resumed the abb¨¦, ¡°that
Dant¨¨s, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that
he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.¡±

¡°And so he was,¡± murmured Caderousse. ¡°How should he have been
otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.¡±

¡°And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he
had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any
foul spot or stain have fallen on it.¡±

And here the look of the abb¨¦, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to
rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was
rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.

¡°A rich Englishman,¡± continued the abb¨¦, ¡°who had been his companion in
misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second
restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he
bestowed on Dant¨¨s upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his
gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dant¨¨s had
nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,
who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,
Dant¨¨s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of
prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond
would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.¡±

¡°Then, I suppose,¡± asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, ¡°that it
was a stone of immense value?¡±

¡°Why, everything is relative,¡± answered the abb¨¦. ¡°To one in Edmond¡¯s
position the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at
fifty thousand francs.¡±

¡°Bless me!¡± exclaimed Caderousse, ¡°fifty thousand francs! Surely the
diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.¡±

¡°No,¡± replied the abb¨¦, ¡°it was not of such a size as that; but you
shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.¡±

The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest¡¯s
garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure.
Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black
shagreen, the abb¨¦ opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of
Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable
workmanship.

¡°And that diamond,¡± cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager
admiration, ¡°you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?¡±

¡°It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,¡± replied the abb¨¦,
as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant
hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.

¡°But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make you
his heir?¡±

¡°No, merely his testamentary executor. ¡®I once possessed four dear and
faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed¡¯ he said;
¡®and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.
The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.¡¯¡± The innkeeper
shivered.

¡°¡®Another of the number,¡¯¡± continued the abb¨¦, without seeming to notice
the emotion of Caderousse, ¡°¡®is called Danglars; and the third, in spite
of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.¡¯¡±

A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about
to break in upon the abb¨¦¡¯s speech, when the latter, waving his hand,
said, ¡°Allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations
to make, you can do so afterwards. ¡®The third of my friends, although my
rival, was much attached to me,¡ªhis name was Fernand; that of my
betrothed was¡¯¡ªStay, stay,¡± continued the abb¨¦, ¡°I have forgotten what
he called her.¡±

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s,¡± said Caderousse eagerly.

¡°True,¡± said the abb¨¦, with a stifled sigh, ¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s it was.¡±

¡°Go on,¡± urged Caderousse.

¡°Bring me a carafe of water,¡± said the abb¨¦.

Caderousse quickly performed the stranger¡¯s bidding; and after pouring
some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abb¨¦,
resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty
glass on the table:

¡°Where did we leave off?¡±

¡°The name of Edmond¡¯s betrothed was Merc¨¦d¨¨s.¡±

¡°To be sure. ¡®You will go to Marseilles,¡¯ said Dant¨¨s,¡ªfor you
understand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them. Do you
understand?¡±

¡°Perfectly.¡±

¡°¡®You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal
parts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only persons
who have loved me upon earth.¡¯¡±

¡°But why into five parts?¡± asked Caderousse; ¡°you only mentioned four
persons.¡±

¡°Because the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmond¡¯s
bequest, was his own father.¡±

¡°Too true, too true!¡± ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the
contending passions which assailed him, ¡°the poor old man did die.¡±

¡°I learned so much at Marseilles,¡± replied the abb¨¦, making a strong
effort to appear indifferent; ¡°but from the length of time that has
elapsed since the death of the elder Dant¨¨s, I was unable to obtain any
particulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?¡±

¡°I do not know who could if I could not,¡± said Caderousse. ¡°Why, I lived
almost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah, yes, about a year
after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died.¡±

¡°Of what did he die?¡±

¡°Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe; his
acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying
moments, I say he died of¡ª¡ª¡±

Caderousse paused.

¡°Of what?¡± asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.

¡°Why, of downright starvation.¡±

¡°Starvation!¡± exclaimed the abb¨¦, springing from his seat. ¡°Why, the
vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. The very
dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying
hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian,
should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call
themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it is
impossible!¡ªutterly impossible!¡±

¡°What I have said, I have said,¡± answered Caderousse.

¡°And you are a fool for having said anything about it,¡± said a voice
from the top of the stairs. ¡°Why should you meddle with what does not
concern you?¡±

The two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La
Carconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of
voices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on
the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing
conversation.

¡°Mind your own business, wife,¡± replied Caderousse sharply. ¡°This
gentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not
permit me to refuse.¡±

¡°Politeness, you simpleton!¡± retorted La Carconte. ¡°What have you to do
with politeness, I should like to know? Better study a little common
prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to
extract all he can from you?¡±

¡°I pledge you my word, madam,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°that my intentions are
good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me
candidly.¡±

¡°Ah, that¡¯s all very fine,¡± retorted the woman. ¡°Nothing is easier than
to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when
poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell
all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly
forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold
trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the
unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions
come.¡±

¡°Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you.
Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my
instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.¡±

La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again
drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two
speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to
hear every word they uttered. Again the abb¨¦ had been obliged to swallow
a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower
him.

When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, ¡°It appears, then,
that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by
everyone. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have perished
by so dreadful a death.¡±

¡°Why, he was not altogether forsaken,¡± continued Caderousse, ¡°for
Merc¨¦d¨¨s the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him; but
somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for
Fernand¡ªthe very person,¡± added Caderousse with a bitter smile, ¡°that
you named just now as being one of Dant¨¨s¡¯ faithful and attached
friends.¡±

¡°And was he not so?¡± asked the abb¨¦.

¡°Gaspard, Gaspard!¡± murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,
¡°mind what you are saying!¡±

Caderousse made no reply to these words, though evidently irritated and
annoyed by the interruption, but, addressing the abb¨¦, said, ¡°Can a man
be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself? But
Dant¨¨s was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he believed
everybody¡¯s professions of friendship. Poor Edmond, he was cruelly
deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might have
found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his enemies.
And, whatever people may say,¡± continued Caderousse, in his native
language, which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, ¡°I cannot help
being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than
the hatred of the living.¡±

¡°Imbecile!¡± exclaimed La Carconte.

¡°Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dant¨¨s?¡± inquired the
abb¨¦ of Caderousse.

¡°Do I? No one better.¡±

¡°Speak out then, say what it was!¡±

¡°Gaspard!¡± cried La Carconte, ¡°do as you will; you are master¡ªbut if you
take my advice you¡¯ll hold your tongue.¡±

¡°Well, wife,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°I don¡¯t know but what you¡¯re right!¡±

¡°So you will say nothing?¡± asked the abb¨¦.

¡°Why, what good would it do?¡± asked Caderousse. ¡°If the poor lad were
living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were
his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not
hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing
to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with
him.¡±

¡°You prefer, then,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°that I should bestow on men you say
are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?¡±

¡°That is true enough,¡± returned Caderousse. ¡°You say truly, the gift of
poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars;
besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the
ocean.¡±

¡°Remember,¡± chimed in La Carconte, ¡°those two could crush you at a
single blow!¡±

¡°How so?¡± inquired the abb¨¦. ¡°Are these persons, then, so rich and
powerful?¡±

¡°Do you not know their history?¡±

¡°I do not. Pray relate it to me!¡±

Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, ¡°No, truly,
it would take up too much time.¡±

¡°Well, my good friend,¡± returned the abb¨¦, in a tone that indicated
utter indifference on his part, ¡°you are at liberty, either to speak or
be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples
and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty as
conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My
first business will be to dispose of this diamond.¡±

So saying, the abb¨¦ again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it,
and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of
brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.

¡°Wife, wife!¡± cried he in a hoarse voice, ¡°come here!¡±

¡°Diamond!¡± exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber
with a tolerably firm step; ¡°what diamond are you talking about?¡±

¡°Why, did you not hear all we said?¡± inquired Caderousse. ¡°It is a
beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dant¨¨s, to be sold, and the money
divided between his father, Merc¨¦d¨¨s, his betrothed bride, Fernand,
Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand
francs.¡±

¡°Oh, what a magnificent jewel!¡± cried the astonished woman.

¡°The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does
it not?¡± asked Caderousse.

¡°It does,¡± replied the abb¨¦; ¡°with the addition of an equal division of
that part intended for the elder Dant¨¨s, which I believe myself at
liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.¡±

¡°And why among us four?¡± inquired Caderousse.

¡°As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.¡±

¡°I don¡¯t call those friends who betray and ruin you,¡± murmured the wife
in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.

¡°Of course not!¡± rejoined Caderousse quickly; ¡°no more do I, and that
was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked
upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps
crime.¡±

¡°Remember,¡± answered the abb¨¦ calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its
case in the pocket of his cassock, ¡°it is your fault, not mine, that I
do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both
Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond¡¯s last wishes.¡±

The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of
perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abb¨¦ rise from
his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse
were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his
wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.

0335m


¡°There, you see, wife,¡± said the former, ¡°this splendid diamond might
all be ours, if we chose!¡±

¡°Do you believe it?¡±

¡°Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!¡±

¡°Well,¡± replied La Carconte, ¡°do as you like. For my part, I wash my
hands of the affair.¡±

So saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber,
her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in
spite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she
turned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband,
¡°Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!¡±

¡°I have both reflected and decided,¡± answered he.

La Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked
beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her
armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.

¡°Well,¡± asked the abb¨¦, as he returned to the apartment below, ¡°what
have you made up your mind to do?¡±

¡°To tell you all I know,¡± was the reply.

¡°I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,¡± said the priest. ¡°Not
because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to
conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could
distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so
much the better, that is all.¡±

¡°I hope it may be so,¡± replied Caderousse, his face flushed with
cupidity.

¡°I am all attention,¡± said the abb¨¦.

¡°Stop a minute,¡± answered Caderousse; ¡°we might be interrupted in the
most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as
well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.¡±

With these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,
by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was
accustomed to do at night.

During this time the abb¨¦ had chosen his place for listening at his
ease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself
would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the
narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather
clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to
Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to
him.

¡°Remember, this is no affair of mine,¡± said the trembling voice of La
Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the
scene that was enacting below.

¡°Enough, enough!¡± replied Caderousse; ¡°say no more about it; I will take
all the consequences upon myself.¡±

And he began his story.






Chapter 27. The Story

First, sir,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°you must make me a promise.¡±

¡°What is that?¡± inquired the abb¨¦.

¡°Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that
you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for the
persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they
only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like
glass.¡±

¡°Make yourself easy, my friend,¡± replied the abb¨¦. ¡°I am a priest, and
confessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry
out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then,
without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I
do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak;
besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and
not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have only
quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.¡±

This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.

¡°Well, then, under these circumstances,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°I will, I
even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor
Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.¡±

¡°Begin with his father, if you please.¡± said the abb¨¦; ¡°Edmond talked to
me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.¡±

¡°The history is a sad one, sir,¡± said Caderousse, shaking his head;
¡°perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?¡±

¡°Yes.¡± answered the abb¨¦; ¡°Edmond related to me everything until the
moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.¡±

¡°At La R¨¦serve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.¡±

¡°Was it not his betrothal feast?¡±

¡°It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a
police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dant¨¨s was
arrested.¡±

¡°Yes, and up to this point I know all,¡± said the priest. ¡°Dant¨¨s himself
only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again
the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of
them.¡±

¡°Well, when Dant¨¨s was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the
particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his
home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up
and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for
I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for
myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor
father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart
as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.

¡°The next day Merc¨¦d¨¨s came to implore the protection of M. de
Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old
man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a
sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished
him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man
would not consent. ¡®No,¡¯ was the old man¡¯s reply, ¡®I will not leave this
house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world;
and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing,
and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?¡¯ I heard all
this from the window, for I was anxious that Merc¨¦d¨¨s should persuade
the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and
day did not leave me a moment¡¯s repose.¡±

¡°But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?¡± asked
the abb¨¦.

¡°Ah, sir,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°we cannot console those who will not be
consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he
seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I
could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door
he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir,
all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was
more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and
hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ¡®It is really well, and I am very
glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such
excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or
heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once,
for I could not bear it.¡¯¡±

¡°Poor father!¡± murmured the priest.

¡°From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.
Morrel and Merc¨¦d¨¨s came to see him, but his door was closed; and,
although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer. One
day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Merc¨¦d¨¨s, and the
poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console
him, he said to her,¡ª¡®Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and
instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy,
for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.¡¯

¡°However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after
a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and
so at last old Dant¨¨s was left all to himself, and I only saw from time
to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they
tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold
by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor
old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters¡¯ rent,
and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which
was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my
apartment when he left his.

¡°For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on
the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all
risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw
him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told M.
Morrel and then ran on to Merc¨¦d¨¨s. They both came immediately, M.
Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of the
bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I never
shall forget the old man¡¯s smile at this prescription.

¡°From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not
eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.¡±

The abb¨¦ uttered a kind of groan.

¡°The story interests you, does it not, sir?¡± inquired Caderousse.

¡°Yes,¡± replied the abb¨¦, ¡°it is very affecting.¡±

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s came again, and she found him so altered that she was even
more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.
Morrel¡¯s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his
consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually
frightened. Merc¨¦d¨¨s remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel
went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on
the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor¡¯s order, the old
man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair
and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery,
and saying to Merc¨¦d¨¨s, ¡®If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die
blessing him.¡¯¡±

The abb¨¦ rose from his chair, made two turns round the chamber, and
pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat.

¡°And you believe he died¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Of hunger, sir, of hunger,¡± said Caderousse. ¡°I am as certain of it as
that we two are Christians.¡±

The abb¨¦, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing
by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat,
with red eyes and pale cheeks.

¡°This was, indeed, a horrid event,¡± said he in a hoarse voice.

¡°The more so, sir, as it was men¡¯s and not God¡¯s doing.¡±

¡°Tell me of those men,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°and remember too,¡± he added in
an almost menacing tone, ¡°you have promised to tell me everything. Tell
me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and
the father with famine?¡±

¡°Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from
ambition,¡ªFernand and Danglars.¡±

¡°How was this jealousy manifested? Speak on.¡±

¡°They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.¡±

¡°Which of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?¡±

¡°Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.¡±

¡°And where was this letter written?¡±

¡°At La R¨¦serve, the day before the betrothal feast.¡±

¡°¡¯Twas so, then¡ª¡¯twas so, then,¡± murmured the abb¨¦. ¡°Oh, Faria, Faria,
how well did you judge men and things!¡±

¡°What did you please to say, sir?¡± asked Caderousse.

¡°Nothing, nothing,¡± replied the priest; ¡°go on.¡±

¡°It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that his
writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the post.¡±

¡°But,¡± exclaimed the abb¨¦ suddenly, ¡°you were there yourself.¡±

¡°I!¡± said Caderousse, astonished; ¡°who told you I was there?¡±

The abb¨¦ saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,¡ª¡°No one;
but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an
eye-witness.¡±

¡°True, true!¡± said Caderousse in a choking voice, ¡°I was there.¡±

¡°And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?¡± asked the abb¨¦; ¡°if
not, you were an accomplice.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°they had made me drink to such an excess
that I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct
understanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in
such a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest they
were carrying on, and perfectly harmless.¡±

¡°Next day¡ªnext day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had
been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when Dant¨¨s
was arrested.¡±

¡°Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars
restrained me. ¡®If he should really be guilty,¡¯ said he, ¡®and did really
put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a letter for
the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this letter upon
him, those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices.¡¯ I
confess I had my fears, in the state in which politics then were, and I
held my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but it was not criminal.¡±

0341m


¡°I understand¡ªyou allowed matters to take their course, that was all.¡±

¡°Yes, sir,¡± answered Caderousse; ¡°and remorse preys on me night and day.
I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action, the only
one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is no
doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a moment of
selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she complains,
¡®Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.¡¯¡± And Caderousse bowed
his head with every sign of real repentance.

¡°Well, sir,¡± said the abb¨¦, ¡°you have spoken unreservedly; and thus to
accuse yourself is to deserve pardon.¡±

¡°Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.¡±

¡°He did not know,¡± said the abb¨¦.

¡°But he knows it all now,¡± interrupted Caderousse; ¡°they say the dead
know everything.¡±

There was a brief silence; the abb¨¦ rose and paced up and down
pensively, and then resumed his seat.

¡°You have two or three times mentioned a M. Morrel,¡± he said; ¡°who was
he?¡±

¡°The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dant¨¨s.¡±

¡°And what part did he play in this sad drama?¡± inquired the abb¨¦.

¡°The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty
times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,
implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second
restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told
you, he came to see Dant¨¨s¡¯ father, and offered to receive him in his
own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already
said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old
man¡¯s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond¡¯s father died, as he
had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still by me¡ªa
large one, made of red silk.¡±

¡°And,¡± asked the abb¨¦, ¡°is M. Morrel still alive?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied Caderousse.

¡°In that case,¡± replied the abb¨¦, ¡°he should be a man blessed of God,
rich, happy.¡±

Caderousse smiled bitterly. ¡°Yes, happy as myself,¡± said he.

¡°What! M. Morrel unhappy?¡± exclaimed the abb¨¦.

¡°He is reduced almost to the last extremity¡ªnay, he is almost at the
point of dishonor.¡±

¡°How?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± continued Caderousse, ¡°so it is; after five-and-twenty years of
labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of
Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two
years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his
only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dant¨¨s commanded, and
which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo.
If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.¡±

¡°And has the unfortunate man wife or children?¡± inquired the abb¨¦.

¡°Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel;
he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose
family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he
has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,
all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were
alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an
end.¡±

¡°Horrible!¡± ejaculated the priest.

¡°And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,¡± added Caderousse. ¡°You
see, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you of¡ªam in
destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and I
unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as
old Dant¨¨s did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth.¡±

¡°How is that?¡±

¡°Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men
have been reduced to misery.¡±

¡°What has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most
guilty?¡±

¡°What has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the
recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier into
a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the
commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that
money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital;
and, having first married his banker¡¯s daughter, who left him a widower,
he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of
M. de Servieux, the king¡¯s chamberlain, who is in high favor at court.
He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the
Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du Mont-Blanc, with ten
horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not
how many millions in his strongbox.¡±

¡°Ah!¡± said the abb¨¦, in a peculiar tone, ¡°he is happy.¡±

¡°Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret
known but to one¡¯s self and the walls¡ªwalls have ears but no tongue; but
if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.¡±

¡°And Fernand?¡±

¡°Fernand? Why, much the same story.¡±

¡°But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or
resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.¡±

¡°And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some
strange secret that no one knows.¡±

¡°But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or
high position?¡±

¡°Both, sir¡ªhe has both fortune and position¡ªboth.¡±

¡°This must be impossible!¡±

¡°It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before
the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him
quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy
was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was
older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent
to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the
frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night
after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on
a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was
to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him;
Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.

¡°Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the
throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to
France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the
general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a
captain in 1823, during the Spanish war¡ªthat is to say, at the time when
Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being
sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found
Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the
support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received
promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths
known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by
the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief
campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and
received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of
Honor.¡±

¡°Destiny! destiny!¡± murmured the abb¨¦.

¡°Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,
Fernand¡¯s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to
endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had
begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens¡ªit
was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,
without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to
volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve
in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.

Some time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the
name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of
instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he
died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a
considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was gazetted
lieutenant-general.¡±

¡°So that now¡ª¡ª?¡± inquired the abb¨¦.

¡°So that now,¡± continued Caderousse, ¡°he owns a magnificent house¡ªNo.
27, Rue du Helder, Paris.¡±

The abb¨¦ opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an
effort at self-control, he said, ¡°And Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡ªthey tell me that she has
disappeared?¡±

¡°Disappeared,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°yes, as the sun disappears, to rise the
next day with still more splendor.¡±

¡°Has she made a fortune also?¡± inquired the abb¨¦, with an ironical
smile.

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,¡±
replied Caderousse.

¡°Go on,¡± said the abb¨¦; ¡°it seems as if I were listening to the story of
a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me
seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.¡±

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived
her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de
Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dant¨¨s. In the midst of her
despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of
Fernand¡ªof Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded
as her brother. Fernand went, and Merc¨¦d¨¨s remained alone.

¡°Three months passed and still she wept¡ªno news of Edmond, no news of
Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with
despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of
two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her
home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew,
turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the
uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.

¡°It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of
her past life had returned to her.

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s seized Fernand¡¯s hands with a transport which he took for
love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and
seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then,
it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated¡ªhe was only not
precisely loved. Another possessed all Merc¨¦d¨¨s¡¯ heart; that other was
absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Merc¨¦d¨¨s
burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the
thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to
her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old
Dant¨¨s incessantly said to her, ¡®Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he
would return to us.¡¯

¡°The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Merc¨¦d¨¨s,
perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been
there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned
of the old man¡¯s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his
first coming he had not said a word of love to Merc¨¦d¨¨s; at the second
he reminded her that he loved her.

¡°Merc¨¦d¨¨s begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for
Edmond.¡±

¡°So that,¡± said the abb¨¦, with a bitter smile, ¡°that makes eighteen
months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?¡± Then he
murmured the words of the English poet, ¡°¡®Frailty, thy name is woman.¡¯¡±

¡°Six months afterwards,¡± continued Caderousse, ¡°the marriage took place
in the church of Accoules.¡±

¡°The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,¡± murmured the
priest; ¡°there was only a change of bridegrooms.¡±

¡°Well, Merc¨¦d¨¨s was married,¡± proceeded Caderousse; ¡°but although in the
eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La
R¨¦serve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been
celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she
looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at
his ease¡ªfor I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond¡¯s
return¡ªFernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart
himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with
the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.¡±

¡°Did you ever see Merc¨¦d¨¨s again?¡± inquired the priest.

¡°Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;
she was attending to the education of her son.¡±

The abb¨¦ started. ¡°Her son?¡± said he.

¡°Yes,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°little Albert.¡±

¡°But, then, to be able to instruct her child,¡± continued the abb¨¦, ¡°she
must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that
she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°did he know so little of his lovely
betrothed? Merc¨¦d¨¨s might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to
be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand¡¯s
fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing
fortune. She learned drawing, music¡ªeverything. Besides, I believe,
between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she
might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the
weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,¡± continued
Caderousse; ¡°no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is
rich, a countess, and yet¡ª¡ª¡±

Caderousse paused.

¡°And yet what?¡± asked the abb¨¦.

¡°Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,¡± said Caderousse.

¡°What makes you believe this?¡±

¡°Why, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old friends
would, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not even
receive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his
valet-de-chambre.¡±

¡°Then you did not see either of them?¡±

¡°No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.¡±

¡°How was that?¡±

¡°As I went away a purse fell at my feet¡ªit contained five-and-twenty
louis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Merc¨¦d¨¨s, who at once shut the
blind.¡±

¡°And M. de Villefort?¡± asked the abb¨¦.

¡°Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had
nothing to ask of him.¡±

¡°Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond¡¯s
misfortunes?¡±

¡°No; I only know that some time after Edmond¡¯s arrest, he married
Mademoiselle de Saint-M¨¦ran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt he
has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars, as
high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor,
wretched, and forgotten.¡±

¡°You are mistaken, my friend,¡± replied the abb¨¦; ¡°God may seem sometimes
to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes
a moment when he remembers¡ªand behold¡ªa proof!¡±

As he spoke, the abb¨¦ took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to
Caderousse, said, ¡°Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.¡±

¡°What, for me only?¡± cried Caderousse, ¡°ah, sir, do not jest with me!¡±

¡°This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one
friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and
sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that
this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.¡±

0351m


¡°Oh, sir,¡± said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the
other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,¡ª¡°Oh, sir, do
not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.¡±

¡°I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of
such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange¡ª¡ª¡±

Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.

The abb¨¦ smiled.

¡°In exchange,¡± he continued, ¡°give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel
left on old Dant¨¨s¡¯ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in
your hands.¡±

Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken
cupboard, opened it, and gave the abb¨¦ a long purse of faded red silk,
round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abb¨¦
took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.

¡°Oh, you are a man of God, sir,¡± cried Caderousse; ¡°for no one knew that
Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.¡±

¡°Which,¡± said the abb¨¦ to himself, ¡°you would have done.¡± The abb¨¦ rose,
took his hat and gloves. ¡°Well,¡± he said, ¡°all you have told me is
perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.¡±

¡°See, sir,¡± replied Caderousse, ¡°in this corner is a crucifix in holy
wood¡ªhere on this shelf is my wife¡¯s testament; open this book, and I
will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by
my soul¡¯s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to
you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear
of God at the day of the last judgment!¡±

¡°¡¯Tis well,¡± said the abb¨¦, convinced by his manner and tone that
Caderousse spoke the truth. ¡°¡¯Tis well, and may this money profit you!
Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.¡±

The abb¨¦ with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of
Caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse, once
more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells, and
then returned by the road he had travelled in coming.

When Caderousse turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and
trembling more than ever.

¡°Is, then, all that I have heard really true?¡± she inquired.

¡°What? That he has given the diamond to us only?¡± inquired Caderousse,
half bewildered with joy; ¡°yes, nothing more true! See, here it is.¡±

The woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice,
¡°Suppose it¡¯s false?¡±

Caderousse started and turned pale.

¡°False!¡± he muttered. ¡°False! Why should that man give me a false
diamond?¡±

0349m


¡°To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!¡±

Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an
idea.

¡°Oh!¡± he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red
handkerchief tied round his head, ¡°we will soon find out.¡±

¡°In what way?¡±

¡°Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from Paris
there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife, and I
shall be back in two hours,¡± and Caderousse left the house in haste, and
ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had
taken.

¡°Fifty thousand francs!¡± muttered La Carconte when left alone; ¡°it is a
large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.¡±

Chapter 28. The Prison Register

The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken
place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about
thirty or two-and-thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen
trousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an
Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles.

¡°Sir,¡± said he, ¡°I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson & French, of
Rome. We are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house of
Morrel & Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or
thereabouts loaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at
reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I
have come, therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± replied the mayor. ¡°I know very well that during the last four or
five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He has lost four
or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but it is
not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten
thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his
finances. Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I
shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up
to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.
This is all I can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself
to M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles; he
has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrel¡¯s hands, and if
there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than
mine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself.¡±

The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow
and went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards
the street mentioned.

M. de Boville was in his private room, and the Englishman, on perceiving
him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to indicate that it was
not the first time he had been in his presence. As to M. de Boville, he
was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all the faculties of
his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment, did
not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past.

The Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him in terms
nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of
Marseilles.

¡°Oh, sir,¡± exclaimed M. de Boville, ¡°your fears are unfortunately but
too well founded, and you see before you a man in despair. I had two
hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two
hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be
married in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were
payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th
of next month. I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these
payments punctually, and he has been here within the last half-hour to
tell me that if his ship, the Pharaon, did not come into port on the
15th, he would be wholly unable to make this payment.¡±

¡°But,¡± said the Englishman, ¡°this looks very much like a suspension of
payment.¡±

¡°It looks more like bankruptcy!¡± exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.

The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, ¡°From which
it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable
apprehension?¡±

¡°To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.¡±

¡°Well, then, I will buy it of you!¡±

¡°You?¡±

¡°Yes, I!¡±

¡°But at a tremendous discount, of course?¡±

¡°No, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house,¡± added the Englishman
with a laugh, ¡°does not do things in that way.¡±

¡°And you will pay¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Ready money.¡±

20023m


And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes, which
might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared to lose. A ray of joy
passed across M. de Boville¡¯s countenance, yet he made an effort at
self-control, and said:

¡°Sir, I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not realize
six per cent of this sum.¡±

¡°That¡¯s no affair of mine,¡± replied the Englishman, ¡°that is the affair
of the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act. They have,
perhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm. But
all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in
exchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a brokerage.¡±

¡°Of course, that is perfectly just,¡± cried M. de Boville. ¡°The
commission is usually one and a half; will you have two¡ªthree¡ªfive per
cent, or even more? Whatever you say.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± replied the Englishman, laughing, ¡°I am like my house, and do not
do such things¡ªno, the commission I ask is quite different.¡±

¡°Name it, sir, I beg.¡±

¡°You are the inspector of prisons?¡±

¡°I have been so these fourteen years.¡±

¡°You keep the registers of entries and departures?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?¡±

¡°There are special reports on every prisoner.¡±

¡°Well, sir, I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abb¨¦, who
disappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the
Chateau d¡¯If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his death.¡±

¡°What was his name?¡±

¡°The Abb¨¦ Faria.¡±

¡°Oh, I recollect him perfectly,¡± cried M. de Boville; ¡°he was crazy.¡±

¡°So they said.¡±

¡°Oh, he was, decidedly.¡±

¡°Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?¡±

¡°He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to
the government if they would liberate him.¡±

¡°Poor devil!¡ªand he is dead?¡±

¡°Yes, sir, five or six months ago, last February.¡±

¡°You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.¡±

¡°I recollect this, because the poor devil¡¯s death was accompanied by a
singular incident.¡±

¡°May I ask what that was?¡± said the Englishman with an expression of
curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at
discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.

¡°Oh dear, yes, sir; the abb¨¦¡¯s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant
from that of one of Bonaparte¡¯s emissaries,¡ªone of those who had
contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very
resolute and very dangerous man.¡±

¡°Indeed!¡± said the Englishman.

¡°Yes,¡± replied M. de Boville; ¡°I myself had occasion to see this man in
1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of
soldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget
his countenance!¡±

20025m


The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.

¡°And you say, sir,¡± he interposed, ¡°that the two dungeons¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this
Edmond Dant¨¨s¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°This dangerous man¡¯s name was¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Edmond Dant¨¨s. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dant¨¨s had procured
tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners
held communication with one another.¡±

¡°This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?¡±

¡°No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abb¨¦ Faria had an
attack of catalepsy, and died.¡±

¡°That must have cut short the projects of escape.¡±

¡°For the dead man, yes,¡± replied M. de Boville, ¡°but not for the
survivor; on the contrary, this Dant¨¨s saw a means of accelerating his
escape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Chateau
d¡¯If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the
dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had
sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.¡±

¡°It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,¡± remarked the
Englishman.

¡°As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,
fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears
it had on his account.¡±

¡°How was that?¡±

¡°How? Do you not comprehend?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°The Chateau d¡¯If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into
the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.¡±

¡°Well?¡± observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.

¡°Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him
into the sea.¡±

¡°Really!¡± exclaimed the Englishman.

¡°Yes, sir,¡± continued the inspector of prisons. ¡°You may imagine the
amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the
rocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.¡±

¡°That would have been difficult.¡±

¡°No matter,¡± replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty
of recovering his two hundred thousand francs,¡ª¡°no matter, I can fancy
it.¡± And he shouted with laughter.

¡°So can I,¡± said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as
the English do, ¡°at the end of his teeth.¡±

¡°And so,¡± continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, ¡°he
was drowned?¡±

¡°Unquestionably.¡±

¡°So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at
the same time?¡±

¡°Precisely.¡±

20027m


¡°But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?¡±
inquired the Englishman.

¡°Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, Dant¨¨s¡¯ relations,
if he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or
alive.¡±

¡°So that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do so
with easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it.¡±

¡°Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.¡±

¡°So be it,¡± said the Englishman. ¡°But to return to these registers.¡±

¡°True, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me.¡±

¡°Excuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to me
very curious.¡±

¡°Yes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abb¨¦,
who really was gentleness itself.¡±

¡°Yes, you will much oblige me.¡±

¡°Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.¡±

And they both entered M. de Boville¡¯s study. Everything was here
arranged in perfect order; each register had its number, each file of
papers its place. The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in
an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents relative
to the Chateau d¡¯If, giving him all the time he desired for the
examination, while De Boville seated himself in a corner, and began to
read his newspaper. The Englishman easily found the entries relative to
the Abb¨¦ Faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had
related interested him greatly, for after having perused the first
documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition
respecting Edmond Dant¨¨s. There he found everything arranged in due
order,¡ªthe accusation, examination, Morrel¡¯s petition, M. de Villefort¡¯s
marginal notes. He folded up the accusation quietly, and put it as
quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the name of
Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application dated
10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureur¡¯s advice,
exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on the
throne) the services Dant¨¨s had rendered to the imperial cause¡ªservices
which Villefort¡¯s certificates rendered indisputable. Then he saw
through the whole thing. This petition to Napoleon, kept back by
Villefort, had become, under the second restoration, a terrible weapon
against him in the hands of the king¡¯s attorney. He was no longer
astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note, placed
in a bracket against his name:

Edmond Dant¨¨s.

An inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the
Island of Elba.

To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and
guarded.

Beneath these lines was written in another hand: ¡°See note above¡ªnothing
can be done.¡±

He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the
certificate placed beneath Morrel¡¯s petition, and discovered that the
note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate¡ªthat is to
say, was in Villefort¡¯s handwriting.

20029m


As to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that it
might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary
interest in Dant¨¨s¡¯ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have
quoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had
felt.

As we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not
disturb the Abb¨¦ Faria¡¯s pupil in his researches, had seated himself in
a corner, and was reading Le Drapeau Blanc. He did not see the
Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by
Danglars under the arbor of La R¨¦serve, and which had the postmark,
¡°Marseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 o¡¯clock, P.M.¡±

But it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little
importance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two
hundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the
Englishman might do, however irregular it might be.

¡°Thanks,¡± said the latter, closing the register with a slam, ¡°I have all
I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me a simple
assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash,
and I will hand you over the money.¡±

He rose, gave his seat to M. de Boville, who took it without ceremony,
and quickly drew up the required assignment, while the Englishman
counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk.






Chapter 29. The House of Morrel & Son

Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well
acquainted with the interior of Morrel¡¯s warehouse, and had returned at
this date, would have found a great change. Instead of that air of life,
of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous
business establishment¡ªinstead of merry faces at the windows, busy
clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors¡ªinstead of the court
filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of
porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and
gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted
corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of
three or four-and-twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel¡¯s daughter, and
had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce
him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called ¡°Cocles,¡±
or ¡°Cock-eye,¡± a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng
this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so completely
replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability, have
replied to anyone who addressed him by it.

Cocles remained in M. Morrel¡¯s service, and a most singular change had
taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank
of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the same
Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of
arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the
world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table,
which he had at his fingers¡¯ ends, no matter what scheme or what trap
was laid to catch him.

In the midst of the disasters that befell the house, Cocles was the only
one unmoved. But this did not arise from a want of affection; on the
contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the rats that one by one forsake
the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor, so all the
numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse.
Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their
departure. Everything was as we have said, a question of arithmetic to
Cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made
with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him that the house
should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the river that had so
long turned his mill should cease to flow.

Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles¡¯ belief; the last month¡¯s
payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had
detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same
evening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,
threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying:

¡°Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.¡±

Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,
himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more
than a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M. Morrel
had passed many an anxious hour.

In order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his
resources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get
bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an
extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wife¡¯s and
daughter¡¯s jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means the end of
the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted. Credit,
owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the
one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month, and
the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M.
de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the
Pharaon, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had
weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in
harbor.

But this vessel which, like the Pharaon, came from Calcutta, had been in
for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the Pharaon.

20033m


Such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.
de Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of
Rome, presented himself at M. Morrel¡¯s.

Emmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of
every new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor, come
in anxiety to question the head of the house. The young man, wishing to
spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned the new-comer;
but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and
that his business was with M. Morrel in person.

Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared, and the young man
bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel¡¯s apartment. Cocles went
first, and the stranger followed him. On the staircase they met a
beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked with anxiety at the
stranger.

¡°M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?¡± said the
cashier.

¡°Yes; I think so, at least,¡± said the young girl hesitatingly. ¡°Go and
see, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman.¡±

¡°It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,¡± returned the
Englishman. ¡°M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has
only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French
of Rome, with whom your father does business.¡±

The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger
and Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office
where Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,
opened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,
conducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which
he closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of
Thomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.

The Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over
the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his
liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the ledger,
arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him
seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the worthy
merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history,
was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow had
ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and
penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being
forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person.

The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled
with interest. ¡°Monsieur,¡± said Morrel, whose uneasiness was increased
by this examination, ¡°you wish to speak to me?¡±

¡°Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?¡±

¡°The house of Thomson & French; at least, so my cashier tells me.¡±

¡°He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or
400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict
punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and
charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
otherwise.¡±

Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was
covered with perspiration.

¡°So then, sir,¡± said Morrel, ¡°you hold bills of mine?¡±

¡°Yes, and for a considerable sum.¡±

¡°What is the amount?¡± asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render
firm.

20035m


¡°Here is,¡± said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his
pocket, ¡°an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville,
the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You acknowledge, of
course, that you owe this sum to him?¡±

¡°Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly
five years ago.¡±

¡°When are you to pay?¡±

¡°Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.¡±

¡°Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all
signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.¡±

¡°I recognize them,¡± said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought
that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his
own signature. ¡°Is this all?¡±

¡°No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been
assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner of
Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500 francs.¡±

It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this
enumeration. ¡°Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred
francs,¡± repeated he.

¡°Yes, sir,¡± replied the Englishman. ¡°I will not,¡± continued he, after a
moment¡¯s silence, ¡°conceal from you, that while your probity and
exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the
report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your
liabilities.¡±

At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale.

¡°Sir,¡± said he, ¡°up to this time¡ªand it is now more than four-and-twenty
years since I received the direction of this house from my father, who
had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years¡ªnever has anything
bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored.¡±

¡°I know that,¡± replied the Englishman. ¡°But as a man of honor should
answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same
punctuality?¡±

Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance
than he had hitherto shown.

¡°To questions frankly put,¡± said he, ¡°a straightforward answer should be
given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for
its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous
accidents, of which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the
Pharaon should be lost, and this last resource be gone¡ª¡ª¡±

The poor man¡¯s eyes filled with tears.

¡°Well,¡± said the other, ¡°if this last resource fail you?¡±

¡°Well,¡± returned Morrel, ¡°it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but,
already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame. I fear I
shall be forced to suspend payment.¡±

¡°Have you no friends who could assist you?¡±

Morrel smiled mournfully.

¡°In business, sir,¡± said he, ¡°one has no friends, only correspondents.¡±

¡°It is true,¡± murmured the Englishman; ¡°then you have but one hope.¡±

¡°But one.¡±

¡°The last?¡±

¡°The last.¡±

¡°So that if this fail¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I am ruined,¡ªcompletely ruined!¡±

¡°As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.¡±

¡°I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes,
passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house, in
hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed me
of the arrival of this ship.¡±

¡°And it is not yours?¡±

¡°No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, La Gironde; she comes from India also;
but she is not mine.¡±

¡°Perhaps she has spoken to the Pharaon, and brings you some tidings of
her?¡±

¡°Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to
receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty is
still hope.¡± Then in a low voice Morrel added,¡ª¡°This delay is not
natural. The Pharaon left Calcutta the 5th of February; she ought to
have been here a month ago.¡±

¡°What is that?¡± said the Englishman. ¡°What is the meaning of that
noise?¡±

¡°Oh, my God!¡± cried Morrel, turning pale, ¡°what is it?¡±

A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and half-
stifled sobs. Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength
failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one
another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with
an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel
expected something¡ªsomething had occasioned the noise, and something
must follow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and
that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the
door. A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking
of hinges was audible.

¡°There are only two persons who have the key to that door,¡± murmured
Morrel, ¡°Cocles and Julie.¡±

At this instant the second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes
bathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting himself
by the arm of the chair. He would have spoken, but his voice failed him.

¡°Oh, father!¡± said she, clasping her hands, ¡°forgive your child for
being the bearer of evil tidings.¡±

Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.

¡°Oh, father, father!¡± murmured she, ¡°courage!¡±

¡°The Pharaon has gone down, then?¡± said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The
young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head
as she lay on her father¡¯s breast.

¡°And the crew?¡± asked Morrel.

¡°Saved,¡± said the girl; ¡°saved by the crew of the vessel that has just
entered the harbor.¡±

Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation
and sublime gratitude.

¡°Thanks, my God,¡± said he, ¡°at least thou strikest but me alone.¡±

A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman.

¡°Come in, come in,¡± said Morrel, ¡°for I presume you are all at the
door.¡±

Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping
bitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible the
rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these
men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself,
and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers,
Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the
centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel¡¯s
family and the sailors at the door.

¡°How did this happen?¡± said Morrel.

¡°Draw nearer, Penelon,¡± said the young man, ¡°and tell us all about it.¡±

An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the
remains of a hat between his hands.

¡°Good-day, M. Morrel,¡± said he, as if he had just quitted Marseilles the
previous evening, and had just returned from Aix or Toulon.

¡°Good-day, Penelon,¡± returned Morrel, who could not refrain from smiling
through his tears, ¡°where is the captain?¡±

¡°The captain, M. Morrel,¡ªhe has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please
God, it won¡¯t be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and
hearty.¡±

¡°Well, now tell your story, Penelon.¡±

20039m


Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth,
turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the
antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.

¡°You see, M. Morrel,¡± said he, ¡°we were somewhere between Cape Blanc and
Cape Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a
week¡¯s calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me¡ªI was at the helm I
should tell you¡ªand says, ¡®Penelon, what do you think of those clouds
coming up over there?¡¯ I was just then looking at them myself. ¡®What do
I think, captain? Why I think that they are rising faster than they have
any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they didn¡¯t
mean mischief.¡¯¡ª¡®That¡¯s my opinion too,¡¯ said the captain, ¡®and I¡¯ll
take precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas. Avast,
there, all hands! Take in the studding-sails and stow the flying jib.¡¯
It was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel. ¡®Ah,¡¯
said the captain, ¡®we have still too much canvas set; all hands lower
the mainsail!¡¯ Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed under
mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails. ¡®Well, Penelon,¡¯ said the
captain, ¡®what makes you shake your head?¡¯ ¡®Why,¡¯ I says, ¡®I still think
you¡¯ve got too much on.¡¯ ¡®I think you¡¯re right,¡¯ answered he, ¡®we shall
have a gale.¡¯ ¡®A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I
don¡¯t know what¡¯s what.¡¯ You could see the wind coming like the dust at
Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business. ¡®Take in two
reefs in the top-sails,¡¯ cried the captain; ¡®let go the bowlin¡¯s, haul
the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the reef-tackles on the
yards.¡¯¡±

20041m


¡°That was not enough for those latitudes,¡± said the Englishman; ¡°I
should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.¡±

His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start. Penelon
put his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus
criticized the man?uvres of his captain.

¡°We did better than that, sir,¡± said the old sailor respectfully; ¡°we
put the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck
our top-sails and scudded under bare poles.¡±

¡°The vessel was very old to risk that,¡± said the Englishman.

¡°Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for
twelve hours we sprung a leak. ¡®Penelon,¡¯ said the captain, ¡®I think we
are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.¡¯ I gave him
the helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water. ¡®All
hands to the pumps!¡¯ I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the
more we pumped the more came in. ¡®Ah,¡¯ said I, after four hours¡¯ work,
¡®since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.¡¯ ¡®Is that the
example you set, Penelon?¡¯ cries the captain; ¡®very well, wait a
minute.¡¯ He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.
¡®I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,¡¯ said
he.¡±

¡°Well done!¡± said the Englishman.

20043m


¡°There¡¯s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,¡± continued
the sailor; ¡°and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone
down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour, but
still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in twelve
hours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes five.
¡®Come,¡¯ said the captain, ¡®we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel
will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship,
let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.¡¯
Now,¡± continued Penelon, ¡°you see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to
his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told
twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to
say, ¡®Get along¡ªsave yourselves.¡¯ We soon launched the boat, and all
eight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he did
not descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the
waist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It was
time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the
broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then
the other way, spun round and round, and then good-bye to the Pharaon.
As for us, we were three days without anything to eat or drink, so that
we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest, when we saw
La Gironde; we made signals of distress, she perceived us, made for us,
and took us all on board. There now, M. Morrel, that¡¯s the whole truth,
on the honor of a sailor; is not it true, you fellows there?¡± A general
murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed
their misfortunes and sufferings.

¡°Well, well,¡± said M. Morrel, ¡°I know there was no one in fault but
destiny. It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his
name. What wages are due to you?¡±

¡°Oh, don¡¯t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.¡±

¡°Yes, but we will talk of it.¡±

¡°Well, then, three months,¡± said Penelon.

¡°Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,¡± said
Morrel. ¡°At another time,¡± added he, ¡°I should have said, Give them,
besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed,
and the little money that remains to me is not my own, so do not think
me mean on this account.¡±

Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.

¡°As for that, M. Morrel,¡± said he, again turning his quid, ¡°as for
that¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°As for what?¡±

¡°The money.¡±

¡°Well¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present,
and that we will wait for the rest.¡±

¡°Thanks, my friends, thanks!¡± cried Morrel gratefully; ¡°take it¡ªtake it;
and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are free to
do so.¡±

These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman. Penelon
nearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.

¡°What, M. Morrel!¡± said he in a low voice, ¡°you send us away; you are
then angry with us!¡±

¡°No, no,¡± said M. Morrel, ¡°I am not angry, quite the contrary, and I do
not send you away; but I have no more ships, and therefore I do not want
any sailors.¡±

¡°No more ships!¡± returned Penelon; ¡°well, then, you¡¯ll build some; we¡¯ll
wait for you.¡±

¡°I have no money to build ships with, Penelon,¡± said the poor owner
mournfully, ¡°so I cannot accept your kind offer.¡±

¡°No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the Pharaon,
under bare poles.¡±

¡°Enough, enough!¡± cried Morrel, almost overpowered; ¡°leave me, I pray
you; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with them, and
see that my orders are executed.¡±

¡°At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?¡± asked Penelon.

¡°Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go.¡± He made a sign to Cocles, who went
first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. ¡°Now,¡±
said the owner to his wife and daughter, ¡°leave me; I wish to speak with
this gentleman.¡±

20045m


And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson & French, who had remained
motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he had taken no
part, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women looked at
this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and retired;
but, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a supplicating
glance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator
would have been surprised to see on his stern features. The two men were
left alone. ¡°Well, sir,¡± said Morrel, sinking into a chair, ¡°you have
heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.¡±

¡°I see,¡± returned the Englishman, ¡°that a fresh and unmerited misfortune
has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to serve you.¡±

¡°Oh, sir!¡± cried Morrel.

¡°Let me see,¡± continued the stranger, ¡°I am one of your largest
creditors.¡±

¡°Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.¡±

¡°Do you wish for time to pay?¡±

¡°A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.¡±

¡°How long a delay do you wish for?¡±

Morrel reflected. ¡°Two months,¡± said he.

¡°I will give you three,¡± replied the stranger.

¡°But,¡± asked Morrel, ¡°will the house of Thomson & French consent?¡±

¡°Oh, I take everything on myself. Today is the 5th of June.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of
September at eleven o¡¯clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven), I
shall come to receive the money.¡±

¡°I shall expect you,¡± returned Morrel; ¡°and I will pay you¡ªor I shall be
dead.¡± These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger
could not hear them. The bills were renewed, the old ones destroyed, and
the poor ship-owner found himself with three months before him to
collect his resources. The Englishman received his thanks with the
phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him with
grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger met
Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality she
was waiting for him. ¡°Oh, sir¡±¡ªsaid she, clasping her hands.

¡°Mademoiselle,¡± said the stranger, ¡°one day you will receive a letter
signed ¡®Sinbad the Sailor.¡¯ Do exactly what the letter bids you, however
strange it may appear.¡±

¡°Yes, sir,¡± returned Julie.

¡°Do you promise?¡±

¡°I swear to you I will.¡±

¡°It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl
you are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you
by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.¡±

Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the
baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the
court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in
either hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. ¡°Come
with me, my friend,¡± said the Englishman; ¡°I wish to speak to you.¡±






Chapter 30. The Fifth of September

The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the
moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so
decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that
fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same
day he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred;
and a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.
Unfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house
of Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards
him; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not
friends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account
for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him;
and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: ¡°We
had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those
300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get
only six or eight per cent of our money back again.¡±

Unfortunately, whether through envy or stupidity, all Morrel¡¯s
correspondents did not take this view; and some even came to a contrary
decision. The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with
scrupulous exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the
Englishman, were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality. Cocles thus
remained in his accustomed tranquillity. It was Morrel alone who
remembered with alarm, that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000
francs of M. de Boville, and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills, for
which, as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons, he had time
granted, he must be a ruined man.

The opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses which
had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him to
remain solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the end
of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual
punctuality. Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the
general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner
had been postponed only until the end of the month.

The month passed, and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all
his resources. Formerly his paper, at any date, was taken with
confidence, and was even in request. Morrel now tried to negotiate bills
at ninety days only, and none of the banks would give him credit.
Fortunately, Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely;
and, as they reached him, he found himself in a condition to meet his
engagements when the end of July came.

The agent of Thomson & French had not been again seen at Marseilles; the
day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had disappeared;
and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor, the
inspector of prisons, and M. Morrel, his departure left no trace except
in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors of the
Pharaon, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they also had
disappeared.

Captain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma. He
delayed presenting himself at Morrel¡¯s, but the owner, hearing of his
arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon¡¯s
recital, of the captain¡¯s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to
console him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain
Gaumard had not dared to apply for.

As he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.
Penelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was newly
clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed,
drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place, passed his quid
from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his great eyes, and
only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him
by a slight pressure in return. Morrel attributed Penelon¡¯s
embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident the good
fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he was, no
doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his bashfulness
arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express ourselves,
worn mourning for the Pharaon longer. Perhaps he had come to tell
Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment from his
new master.

¡°Worthy fellows!¡± said Morrel, as he went away, ¡°may your new master
love you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!¡±

20049m


August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his
credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at
Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said
that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that
Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier
Cocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when
the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared
behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the
usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual
precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully
anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the
shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and then, with
the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure was put off
until the end of September.

On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme
anxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel
had thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under
great obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing
that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he
had laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment
that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had
unlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his
pocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and
Morrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept away
from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible
availing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he
returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.

Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh
word. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel¡¯s hand
with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the second
floor had sent for Cocles.

¡°Then,¡± said the two women to Emmanuel, ¡°we are indeed ruined.¡±

It was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should
write to her brother, who was in garrison at N?mes, to come to them as
speedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they
required all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,
Maximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence
over his father.

He was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided
on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had
consulted young Maximilian¡¯s taste. He had at once declared for a
military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly
through the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the
53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected
promotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was
noted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on a
soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name of
¡°the stoic.¡± We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this
epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know
what it meant.

This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to
sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon
have to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for the
moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles, Julie
saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features betraying the
utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he passed by her,
but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual
precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed:

¡°Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could
ever have believed it!¡±

A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three
heavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.

Morrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the
money. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills
receivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of
everything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500
francs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on
account.

However, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest
dejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and used
to take his coffee at the club of the Phoc¨¦ens, and read the Semaphore;
this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his office.

As to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he
went into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare
and exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women, but
his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with the
business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over
the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping that
when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard him pass
before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps.
They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened the door
inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an hour after
Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went stealthily
along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her husband was
doing.

In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy
herself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards Madame
Morrel.

¡°He is writing,¡± she said.

They had understood each other without speaking. Madame Morrel looked
again through the keyhole, Morrel was writing; but Madame Morrel
remarked, what her daughter had not observed, that her husband was
writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he was writing his will
flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to utter a
word.

Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as
usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he
placed his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her
for a long time against his bosom. In the evening, Julie told her
mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that
her father¡¯s heart beat violently.

The next two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the 4th
of September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study.
Julie trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen. Why did
her father ask for this key which she always kept, and which was only
taken from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl looked at
Morrel.

¡°What have I done wrong, father,¡± she said, ¡°that you should take this
key from me?¡±

¡°Nothing, my dear,¡± replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his
eyes at this simple question,¡ª¡°nothing, only I want it.¡±

Julie made a pretence to feel for the key. ¡°I must have left it in my
room,¡± she said.

And she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to
consult Emmanuel.

¡°Do not give this key to your father,¡± said he, ¡°and tomorrow morning,
if possible, do not quit him for a moment.¡±

She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he
knew.

During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel
remained listening for every sound, and, until three o¡¯clock in the
morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It
was three o¡¯clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and
daughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since
the previous evening. At eight o¡¯clock in the morning Morrel entered
their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible
in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he had
slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his daughter,
than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and kissing the
sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel¡¯s request, was following her
father when he quitted the room, but he said to her quickly:

¡°Remain with your mother, dearest.¡± Julie wished to accompany him. ¡°I
wish you to do so,¡± said he.

This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a
tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She
remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant
afterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth
pressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.

20053m


¡°Maximilian, my dearest brother!¡± she cried.

At these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son¡¯s
arms.

¡°Mother,¡± said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and
her daughter, ¡°what has occurred¡ªwhat has happened? Your letter has
frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.¡±

¡°Julie,¡± said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, ¡°go and
tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.¡±

The young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the
staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand.

¡°Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?¡± inquired the man, with a strong
Italian accent.

¡°Yes, sir,¡± replied Julie with hesitation; ¡°what is your pleasure? I do
not know you.¡±

¡°Read this letter,¡± he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. ¡°It
concerns the best interests of your father,¡± said the messenger.

The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly
and read:

¡°Go this moment to the All¨¦es de Meilhan, enter the house No. 15, ask
the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the
apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red
silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive
it before eleven o¡¯clock. You promised to obey me implicitly. Remember
your oath.

¡°Sinbad the Sailor.¡±

The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to
question the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes again
over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a
postscript. She read:

¡°It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and
alone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else
go in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything
about it.¡±

This postscript decreased greatly the young girl¡¯s happiness. Was there
nothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her innocence
had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl
of her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it;
indeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that
inspire the greatest terror.

Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular
impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,
but to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the
day when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her father¡¯s, related
the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and
showed him the letter.

¡°You must go, then, mademoiselle,¡± said Emmanuel.

¡°Go there?¡± murmured Julie.

¡°Yes; I will accompany you.¡±

¡°But did you not read that I must be alone?¡± said Julie.

¡°And you shall be alone,¡± replied the young man. ¡°I will await you at
the corner of the Rue du Mus¨¦e, and if you are so long absent as to make
me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall
have cause to complain to me!¡±

¡°Then, Emmanuel?¡± said the young girl with hesitation, ¡°it is your
opinion that I should obey this invitation?¡±

¡°Yes. Did not the messenger say your father¡¯s safety depended upon it?¡±

¡°But what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?¡± she asked.

Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide
immediately made him reply.

¡°Listen,¡± he said; ¡°today is the 5th of September, is it not?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Today, then, at eleven o¡¯clock, your father has nearly three hundred
thousand francs to pay?¡±

¡°Yes, we know that.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± continued Emmanuel, ¡°we have not fifteen thousand francs
in the house.¡±

¡°What will happen then?¡±

¡°Why, if today before eleven o¡¯clock your father has not found someone
who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o¡¯clock to
declare himself a bankrupt.¡±

¡°Oh, come, then, come!¡± cried she, hastening away with the young man.

During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young
man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which had
befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of
living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached
such a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the
apartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study,
but he rapped there in vain.

While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door
open, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study,
M. Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment
quitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of
whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,
pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.
Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his
father¡¯s neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on
Morrel¡¯s breast.

¡°Father,¡± he exclaimed, turning pale as death, ¡°what are you going to do
with that brace of pistols under your coat?¡±

¡°Oh, this is what I feared!¡± said Morrel.

¡°Father, father, in Heaven¡¯s name,¡± exclaimed the young man, ¡°what are
these weapons for?¡±

¡°Maximilian,¡± replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, ¡°you are a
man, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.¡±

And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian
followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed
it behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on
which he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open
ledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his
affairs. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he
possessed was 15,257 francs.

¡°Read!¡± said Morrel.

The young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What
could he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?

¡°And have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this disastrous
result?¡± asked the young man, after a moment¡¯s pause.

¡°I have,¡± replied Morrel.

¡°You have no money coming in on which you can rely?¡±

¡°None.¡±

¡°You have exhausted every resource?¡±

¡°All.¡±

¡°And in half an hour,¡± said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, ¡°our name is
dishonored!¡±

¡°Blood washes out dishonor,¡± said Morrel.

¡°You are right, father; I understand you.¡± Then extending his hand
towards one of the pistols, he said, ¡°There is one for you and one for
me¡ªthanks!¡±

Morrel caught his hand. ¡°Your mother¡ªyour sister! Who will support
them?¡±

A shudder ran through the young man¡¯s frame. ¡°Father,¡± he said, ¡°do you
reflect that you are bidding me to live?¡±

¡°Yes, I do so bid you,¡± answered Morrel, ¡°it is your duty. You have a
calm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I
make no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as
if it were your own, and then judge for yourself.¡±

The young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime
resignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he
took off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank.

¡°Be it so, then, my father,¡± he said, extending his hand to Morrel, ¡°die
in peace, my father; I will live.¡±

Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son, but
Maximilian caught him in his arms, and those two noble hearts were
pressed against each other for a moment.

¡°You know it is not my fault,¡± said Morrel.

20057m


Maximilian smiled. ¡°I know, father, you are the most honorable man I
have ever known.¡±

¡°Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your
mother and sister.¡±

¡°My father,¡± said the young man, bending his knee, ¡°bless me!¡± Morrel
took the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and
kissing his forehead several times said:

¡°Oh, yes, yes, I bless you in my own name, and in the name of three
generations of irreproachable men, who say through me, ¡®The edifice
which misfortune has destroyed, Providence may build up again.¡¯ On
seeing me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you.
To you, perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me. Then
do your best to keep our name free from dishonor. Go to work, labor,
young man, struggle ardently and courageously; live, yourself, your
mother and sister, with the most rigid economy, so that from day to day
the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and
fructify. Reflect how glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn,
that day of complete restoration, on which you will say in this very
office, ¡®My father died because he could not do what I have this day
done; but he died calmly and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I
should do.¡¯¡±

¡°My father, my father!¡± cried the young man, ¡°why should you not live?¡±

¡°If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be converted
into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man who has
broken his word, failed in his engagements¡ªin fact, only a bankrupt. If,
on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is that of an
honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would avoid my
house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home.
Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your head
and say, ¡®I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first time,
he has been compelled to break his word.¡¯¡±

The young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.

¡°And now,¡± said Morrel, ¡°leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your
mother and sister away.¡±

¡°Will you not see my sister once more?¡± asked Maximilian. A last but
final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this
interview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. ¡°I
saw her this morning, and bade her adieu.¡±

¡°Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?¡± inquired
Maximilian in a faltering voice.

¡°Yes; my son, and a sacred command.¡±

¡°Say it, my father.¡±

¡°The house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or,
it may be, selfishness¡ªit is not for me to read men¡¯s hearts¡ªhas had any
pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to
receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,
but offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my son,
and respect this man.¡±

¡°Father, I will,¡± said Maximilian.

¡°And now, once more, adieu,¡± said Morrel. ¡°Go, leave me; I would be
alone. You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom.¡±

The young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of
will and not the power of execution.

¡°Hear me, Maximilian,¡± said his father. ¡°Suppose I were a soldier like
you, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I must be
killed in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just now,
¡®Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is preferable to
shame!¡¯¡±

¡°Yes, yes,¡± said the young man, ¡°yes;¡± and once again embracing his
father with convulsive pressure, he said, ¡°Be it so, my father.¡±

And he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel
remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then
putting forth his arm, he pulled the bell. After a moment¡¯s interval,
Cocles appeared.

It was no longer the same man¡ªthe fearful revelations of the three last
days had crushed him. This thought¡ªthe house of Morrel is about to stop
payment¡ªbent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise
have done.

¡°My worthy Cocles,¡± said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, ¡°do
you remain in the antechamber. When the gentleman who came three months
ago¡ªthe agent of Thomson & French¡ªarrives, announce his arrival to me.¡±

Cocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the
anteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell back in his chair, his eyes
fixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left, that was all. The
hand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.

What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony
cannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was
surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced
himself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly
plausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the
world, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings, one
must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and
its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on. The
pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and
murmured his daughter¡¯s name. Then he laid it down, seized his pen, and
wrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient
farewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the clock,
counting time now not by minutes, but by seconds.

He took up the deadly weapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed
on the clock, and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he
cocked the pistol. At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came
forth upon his brow, a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart-
strings. He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges¡ªthe
clock gave its warning to strike eleven¡ªthe door of his study opened.
Morrel did not turn round¡ªhe expected these words of Cocles, ¡°The agent
of Thomson & French.¡±

He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard
a cry¡ªit was his daughter¡¯s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol
fell from his hands.

¡°My father!¡± cried the young girl, out of breath, and half dead with
joy¡ª¡°saved, you are saved!¡± And she threw herself into his arms, holding
in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.

20061m


¡°Saved, my child!¡± said Morrel; ¡°what do you mean?¡±

¡°Yes, saved¡ªsaved! See, see!¡± said the young girl.

Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance
reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end was the
receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond as
large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of parchment:
Julie¡¯s Dowry.

Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this
moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer
fell upon his heart.

¡°Explain, my child,¡± he said, ¡°Explain, my child,¡± he said,
¡°explain¡ªwhere did you find this purse?¡±

¡°In a house in the All¨¦es de Meilhan, No. 15, on the corner of a
mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.¡±

¡°But,¡± cried Morrel, ¡°this purse is not yours!¡± Julie handed to her
father the letter she had received in the morning.

¡°And did you go alone?¡± asked Morrel, after he had read it.

¡°Emmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the
corner of the Rue du Mus¨¦e, but, strange to say, he was not there when I
returned.¡±

¡°Monsieur Morrel!¡± exclaimed a voice on the stairs; ¡°Monsieur Morrel!¡±

¡°It is his voice!¡± said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel entered, his
countenance full of animation and joy.

¡°The Pharaon!¡± he cried; ¡°the Pharaon!¡±

¡°What!¡ªwhat!¡ªthe Pharaon! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know the vessel is
lost.¡±

¡°The Pharaon, sir¡ªthey signal the Pharaon! The Pharaon is entering the
harbor!¡±

Morrel fell back in his chair, his strength was failing him; his
understanding weakened by such events, refused to comprehend such
incredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts. But his son came in.

¡°Father,¡± cried Maximilian, ¡°how could you say the Pharaon was lost? The
lookout has signalled her, and they say she is now coming into port.¡±

20063m


¡°My dear friends,¡± said Morrel, ¡°if this be so, it must be a miracle of
heaven! Impossible, impossible!¡±

But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his
hand, the acceptance receipted¡ªthe splendid diamond.

¡°Ah, sir,¡± exclaimed Cocles, ¡°what can it mean?¡ªthe Pharaon?¡±

¡°Come, dear ones,¡± said Morrel, rising from his seat, ¡°let us go and
see, and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!¡±

They all went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been
afraid to go up into the study. In a moment they were at the Canebi¨¨re.
There was a crowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel.
¡°The Pharaon! the Pharaon!¡± said every voice.

And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship
bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, ¡°The
Pharaon, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.¡± She was the exact duplicate of
the other Pharaon, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and
indigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain
Gaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M. Morrel.
To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the
senses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony.

As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and
amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with
his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the
sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low
tone:

¡°Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and
wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your
good deeds.¡±

20064m


And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding-
place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps
provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted ¡°Jacopo,
Jacopo, Jacopo!¡±

Then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a
yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity of
a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping with
joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him, and
thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking
in the skies.

¡°And now,¡± said the unknown, ¡°farewell kindness, humanity, and
gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have
been Heaven¡¯s substitute to recompense the good¡ªnow the god of vengeance
yields to me his power to punish the wicked!¡±

At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,
the yacht instantly put out to sea.






Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor

Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the
first society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron
Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at
Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had
inhabited Italy, should act as cicerone to Albert.

As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome,
especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del
Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the
proprietor of the H?tel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve
comfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had
only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the
low charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to
make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.
As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few
days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or three
evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into
his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to
visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.

One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring
that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and
lay down, and said to the crew,¡ª¡°To the Island of Elba!¡±

The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz
disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having
followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-
embarked for Marciana.

Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that
red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in
killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he
returned to the boat very much out of temper.

¡°Ah, if your excellency chose,¡± said the captain, ¡°you might have
capital sport.¡±

¡°Where?¡±

¡°Do you see that island?¡± continued the captain, pointing to a conical
pile rising from the indigo sea.

¡°Well, what is this island?¡±

¡°The Island of Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°But I have no permission to shoot over this island.¡±

¡°Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is
uninhabited.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed!¡± said the young man. ¡°A desert island in the midst of the
Mediterranean must be a curiosity.¡±

¡°It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not
contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.¡±

¡°To whom does this island belong?¡±

¡°To Tuscany.¡±

¡°What game shall I find there!¡±

¡°Thousands of wild goats.¡±

¡°Who live upon the stones, I suppose,¡± said Franz with an incredulous
smile.

¡°No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices
of the rocks.¡±

¡°Where can I sleep?¡±

¡°On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your
excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like¡ªwe can sail as well
by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.¡±

As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet
available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the
affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
¡°Well,¡± asked he, ¡°what now? Is there any difficulty in the way?¡±

¡°No.¡± replied the captain, ¡°but we must warn your excellency that the
island is an infected port.¡±

¡°What do you mean?¡±

¡°Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge
for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and
Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have
to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.¡±

¡°The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,
that¡¯s as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a
wait¡ªtoo long.¡±

¡°But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°Oh, I shall not,¡± cried Franz.

¡°Nor I, nor I,¡± chorused the sailors.

¡°Then steer for Monte Cristo.¡±

The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon
sailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in
order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken
their places¡ªthree forward, and one at the helm¡ªhe resumed the
conversation. ¡°Gaetano,¡± said he to the captain, ¡°you tell me Monte
Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very
different kind of game from the goats.¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency, and it is true.¡±

¡°I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of
Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the
romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.¡±

¡°Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who
were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,
every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency
heard that the French charg¨¦ d¡¯affaires was robbed six months ago within
five hundred paces of Velletri?¡±

¡°Oh, yes, I heard that.¡±

¡°Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would
hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English
yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita
Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,
doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has
met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who
have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some
desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses
of a forest.¡±

¡°But,¡± asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the
boat, ¡°why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French,
Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?¡±

¡°Why?¡± said Gaetano with a smile.

¡°Yes, why?¡±

¡°Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their own
boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand and
foot, they attach to everyone¡¯s neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball, a
large hole is chopped in the vessel¡¯s bottom, and then they leave her.
At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle
down. First one gun¡¯l goes under, then the other. Then they lift and
sink again, and both go under at once. All at once there¡¯s a noise like
a cannon¡ªthat¡¯s the air blowing up the deck. Soon the water rushes out
of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last
groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool
in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but
the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the
sea. Do you understand now,¡± said the captain, ¡°why no complaints are
made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?¡±

It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing
the expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had
started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of
those men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself,
combat it with the most unalterable coolness. Calm and resolute, he
treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,¡ªcalculated its
probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of
strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack,
and won victory at a single thrust.

¡°Bah!¡± said he, ¡°I have travelled through Sicily and Calabria¡ªI have
sailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the
shadow of a bandit or a pirate.¡±

¡°I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,¡±
replied Gaetano, ¡°but you questioned me, and I have answered; that¡¯s
all.¡±

¡°Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy
it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.¡±

The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and
they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near
the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that
they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like
cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the
crevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil
yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully
watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a
few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.

They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set
behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their
rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant
Adamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the
light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow.
Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it
the last rays of the expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the
summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest
of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered
the base, and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that
grew continually darker; half an hour after, the night was quite dark.

Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every
rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz
was not without uneasiness¡ªCorsica had long since disappeared, and Monte
Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the lynx, to
see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest
hesitation.

An hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied he saw, at
a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not precisely
make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by
mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent; suddenly a
great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a cloud, but the
fire was not a meteor.

¡°What is this light?¡± asked he.

¡°Hush!¡± said the captain; ¡°it is a fire.¡±

¡°But you told me the island was uninhabited?¡±

¡°I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it
served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.¡±

¡°And for pirates?¡±

¡°And for pirates,¡± returned Gaetano, repeating Franz¡¯s words. ¡°It is for
that reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you see, the
fire is behind us.¡±

¡°But this fire?¡± continued Franz. ¡°It seems to me rather reassuring than
otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire.¡±

¡°Oh, that goes for nothing,¡± said Gaetano. ¡°If you can guess the
position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire
cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.¡±

¡°You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant
neighbors?¡±

¡°That is what we must find out,¡± returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on
this terrestrial star.

¡°How can you find out?¡±

¡°You shall see.¡±

Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes¡¯
discussion a man?uvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack
about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the
fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The pilot again
changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the island, and
was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail, and the
boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the moment
that their course was changed not a word was spoken.

Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the
responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him,
while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row
away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult. As for
Franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two double-
barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the priming, and
waited quietly.

During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and
secured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no
shoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his
finger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam
towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear
the slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line
in his wake. This track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had
touched the shore.

Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same
luminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.

¡°Well?¡± exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.

¡°They are Spanish smugglers,¡± said he; ¡°they have with them two Corsican
bandits.¡±

¡°And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers?¡±

¡°Alas,¡± returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,
¡°we ought always to help one another. Very often the bandits are hard
pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good
fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you
can¡¯t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for
greater security we stand out to sea. This costs us nothing, and saves
the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the
first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where
we can land our goods without interruption.¡±

¡°Ah!¡± said Franz, ¡°then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?¡±

¡°Your excellency, we must live somehow,¡± returned the other, smiling
impenetrably.

¡°Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by
signs.¡±

¡°And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?¡±

¡°Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.¡±

¡°But these two Corsican bandits?¡± said Franz, calculating the chances of
peril.

¡°It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the
authorities.¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in a
Corsican¡¯s nature to revenge himself.¡±

¡°What do you mean by having made a stiff?¡ªhaving assassinated a man?¡±
said Franz, continuing his investigation.

¡°I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
thing,¡± returned the captain.

¡°Well,¡± said the young man, ¡°let us demand hospitality of these
smugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?¡±

¡°Without doubt.¡±

¡°How many are they?¡±

¡°Four, and the two bandits make six.¡±

¡°Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to
hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.¡±

¡°By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do more
than permit, I exhort you.¡±

¡°Silence, then!¡± said Gaetano.

Everyone obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its
true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with
sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to
him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who
had often examined his weapons,¡ªwhich were very beautiful,¡ªif not with
envy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,
without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed,
a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford
him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. The history
of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day,
seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible
sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand.

The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more
cleaving the waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now more
accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat was
sailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more
brilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated. The blaze
illumined the sea for a hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the light,
carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite
the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a fishing
song, of which his companions sung the chorus.

At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and
approached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently
seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions.
They soon appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one,
who remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a goat
was roasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore, the
man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the manner
of a sentinel, and cried, ¡°Who comes there?¡± in Sardinian.

Franz coolly cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words
with this man which the traveller did not understand, but which
evidently concerned him.

¡°Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?¡± asked the
captain.

¡°My name must rest unknown,¡± replied Franz; ¡°merely say I am a Frenchman
travelling for pleasure.¡±

As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an
order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared
among the rocks. Not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz
with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers with
their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident
that they mutually observed each other.

The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to
that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel,
who, turning to the boat, said, ¡°S¡¯accommodi.¡± The Italian s¡¯accommodi
is untranslatable; it means at once, ¡°Come, enter, you are welcome; make
yourself at home; you are the master.¡± It is like that Turkish phrase of
Moli¨¨re¡¯s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of
things implied in its utterance.

The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the
oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few words
with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came Franz.
One of his guns was swung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the other, and
a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy, did not
excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude. The boat was
moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable
bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler
who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out:

¡°Not that way, if you please.¡±

Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two
sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.

They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade
surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike sentry-
boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and
thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of
cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this
retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the
wandering visitors of Monte Cristo.

As for his suspicions, once on terra firma, once that he had seen the
indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had
quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to
appetite. He mentioned this to Gaetano, who replied that nothing could
be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat,
bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them by.

¡°Besides,¡± added he, ¡°if the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I
will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.¡±

¡°You are a born diplomat,¡± returned Franz; ¡°go and try.¡±

Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which
they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the
roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.

¡°Well,¡± said Franz, ¡°anything new?¡ªdo they refuse?¡±

¡°On the contrary,¡± returned Gaetano, ¡°the chief, who was told you were a
young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.¡±

¡°Well,¡± observed Franz, ¡°this chief is very polite, and I see no
objection¡ªthe more so as I bring my share of the supper.¡±

¡°Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive
you at his house.¡±

¡°His house? Has he built one here, then?¡±

¡°No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.¡±

¡°You know this chief, then?¡±

¡°I have heard talk of him.¡±

¡°Favorably or otherwise?¡±

¡°Both.¡±

¡°The deuce!¡ªand what is this condition?¡±

¡°That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he
himself bids you.¡±

Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this
proposal. ¡°Ah,¡± replied he, guessing Franz¡¯s thought, ¡°I know this is a
serious matter.¡±

¡°What should you do in my place?¡±

¡°I, who have nothing to lose,¡ªI should go.¡±

20075m


¡°You would accept?¡±

¡°Yes, were it only out of curiosity.¡±

¡°There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?¡±

¡°Listen,¡± said Gaetano, lowering his voice, ¡°I do not know if what they
say is true¡±¡ªhe stopped to see if anyone was near.

¡°What do they say?¡±

¡°That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is
nothing.¡±

¡°What nonsense!¡± said Franz, reseating himself.

¡°It is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the Saint
Ferdinand, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such
treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.¡±

¡°Do you know,¡± observed Franz, ¡°that with such stories you make me think
of Ali Baba¡¯s enchanted cavern?¡±

¡°I tell you what I have been told.¡±

¡°Then you advise me to accept?¡±

¡°Oh, I don¡¯t say that; your excellency will do as you please; I should
be sorry to advise you in the matter.¡±

Franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so
rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he
had, and seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. Gaetano
departed with the reply. Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he
possibly could concerning his host. He turned towards the sailor, who,
during this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the
air of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had
landed, as no vessel of any kind was visible.

¡°Never mind that,¡± returned the sailor, ¡°I know their vessel.¡±

¡°Is it a very beautiful vessel?¡±

¡°I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.¡±

¡°Of what burden is she?¡±

¡°About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is
what the English call a yacht.¡±

¡°Where was she built?¡±

¡°I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.¡±

¡°And how did a leader of smugglers,¡± continued Franz, ¡°venture to build
a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?¡±

¡°I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,¡± replied the sailor.

¡°No; but Gaetano did, I thought.¡±

¡°Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then
spoken to anyone.¡±

¡°And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?¡±

¡°A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.¡±

¡°Come,¡± thought Franz, ¡°he is still more mysterious, since the two
accounts do not agree.¡±

¡°What is his name?¡±

¡°If you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his
real name.¡±

¡°Sinbad the Sailor?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And where does he reside?¡±

¡°On the sea.¡±

¡°What country does he come from?¡±

¡°I do not know.¡±

¡°Have you ever seen him?¡±

¡°Sometimes.¡±

¡°What sort of a man is he?¡±

¡°Your excellency will judge for yourself.¡±

¡°Where will he receive me?¡±

¡°No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.¡±

¡°Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this
island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?¡±

¡°Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto all
over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they
say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.¡±

¡°Decidedly,¡± muttered Franz, ¡°this is an Arabian Nights¡¯ adventure.¡±

¡°His excellency waits for you,¡± said a voice, which he recognized as
that of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yacht¡¯s crew.

Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the man
who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes
with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some
indiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make
the least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.

Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and
preceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the
appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was
passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,
evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not
allow Gaetano to go¡ªa refusal he could now comprehend.

Presently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were
entering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a
crackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed,
and became balmy and perfumed. At length his feet touched on a thick and
soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him. There was a
moment¡¯s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with
a foreign accent, said:

¡°Welcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.¡±

It may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this
permission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the
presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a
Tunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk
tassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep
red, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold
like the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his
waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his
girdle.

Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably
handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite
straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek
type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by
the black moustache that encircled them.

His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had
been long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow
and hue of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made,
and, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet. But what
astonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano¡¯s description as a fable, was
the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.

The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers
of gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of
Arabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with
gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape
and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk
to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered,
and also in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which
seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.

The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover,
returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.

¡°Sir,¡± he said, after a pause, ¡°a thousand excuses for the precaution
taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the greater portion of
the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of this abode were
discovered, I should doubtless, find on my return my temporary
retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be exceedingly
annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I should not
have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest
of mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you forget this
temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not expect
to find here¡ªthat is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable
beds.¡±

¡°Ma foi, my dear sir,¡± replied Franz, ¡°make no apologies. I have always
observed that they bandage people¡¯s eyes who penetrate enchanted
palaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the Huguenots, and really I
have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of the
wonders of the Arabian Nights.¡±

20079m


¡°Alas! I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the honor of
your visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my hermitage,
it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to share, if
you will. Ali, is the supper ready?¡±

At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony,
and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all
was prepared in the dining-room.

¡°Now,¡± said the unknown to Franz, ¡°I do not know if you are of my
opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or
three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to
address one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of
hospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me one
by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself, that
I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called
¡®Sinbad the Sailor.¡¯¡±

¡°And I,¡± replied Franz, ¡°will tell you, as I only require his wonderful
lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at this
moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will keep us from going away
from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some
good genius.¡±

¡°Well, then, Signor Aladdin,¡± replied the singular Amphitryon, ¡°you
heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the
dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?¡±

At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.
Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was
splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast
his eyes around him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the
room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-
reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment,
which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their
hands. These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit;
there were Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from
the Balearic Isles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis.

The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican
blackbirds; a boar¡¯s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar
sauce, a glorious turbot, and a gigantic lobster. Between these large
dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties. The dishes were of
silver, and the plates of Japanese china.

Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a
dream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so
admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.

¡°Yes,¡± replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease
and grace¡ª¡°yes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does
all he can to prove it. He remembers that I saved his life, and as he
has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having
kept it on his shoulders.¡±

Ali approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.

¡°Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,¡± said Franz, ¡°to ask you the
particulars of this kindness?¡±

20081m


¡°Oh, they are simple enough,¡± replied the host. ¡°It seems the fellow had
been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than
etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the Bey
to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue
the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I always had
a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue
was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a
splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of
having. He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the
poor devil¡¯s punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass
with which I had shivered his highness¡¯s yataghan to pieces, the Bey
yielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that
the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless clause
in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the
shores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to appear
again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.¡±

Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think
of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the
brief narrative.

¡°And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,¡± he said,
by way of changing the conversation, ¡°you pass your life in travelling?¡±

¡°Yes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able
to accomplish it,¡± said the unknown with a singular smile; ¡°and I made
some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.¡±

Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave
forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.

¡°You have suffered a great deal, sir?¡± said Franz inquiringly.

Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, ¡°What makes you
suppose so?¡±

¡°Everything,¡± answered Franz,¡ª¡°your voice, your look, your pallid
complexion, and even the life you lead.¡±

¡°I?¡ªI live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha. I am
king of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I get
tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like one;
my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself by
delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I
have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or
appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you had
tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return
to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.¡±

¡°Revenge, for instance!¡± observed Franz.

The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate
into the depth of the heart and thoughts. ¡°And why revenge?¡± he asked.

¡°Because,¡± replied Franz, ¡°you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by
society, has a fearful account to settle with it.¡±

¡°Ah!¡± responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which
displayed his white and sharp teeth. ¡°You have not guessed rightly. Such
as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I shall
go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little blue
cloak.¡±

¡°And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?¡±

¡°Yes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you
that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long¡ªit will happen one day
or the other.¡±

20083m


¡°And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?¡±

¡°I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain
arrangements.¡±

¡°I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor to
repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality
displayed to me at Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,¡± replied the host,
¡°but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability,
incognito.¡±

The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the
unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to
which his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or
rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on
the table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a
silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table
roused Franz¡¯s curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish
paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly
unknown to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup
contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting his
eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.

¡°You cannot guess,¡± said he, ¡°what there is in that small vase, can
you?¡±

¡°No, I really cannot.¡±

¡°Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which
Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.¡±

¡°But,¡± replied Franz, ¡°this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through
mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name;
in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which, to tell
the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?¡±

¡°Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,¡± cried Sinbad; ¡°we
frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without regarding
it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing it. Are you a
man for the substantials, and is gold your god? taste this, and the
mines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to you. Are you a man of
imagination¡ªa poet? taste this, and the boundaries of possibility
disappear; the fields of infinite space open to you, you advance free in
heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie.
Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?
taste this, and in an hour you will be a king, not a king of a petty
kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France, Spain, or England,
but king of the world, king of the universe, king of creation; without
bowing at the feet of Satan, you will be king and master of all the
kingdoms of the earth. Is it not tempting what I offer you, and is it
not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus? look!¡±

At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance
so lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his
lips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent
backwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite
sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:

¡°What, then, is this precious stuff?¡±

¡°Did you ever hear,¡± he replied, ¡°of the Old Man of the Mountain, who
attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?¡±

¡°Of course I have.¡±

¡°Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the
mountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were
magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens
isolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and
there, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which
transported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,
ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took
for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,
so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave
it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck
down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing
that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of
delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight
foretaste.¡±

¡°Then,¡± cried Franz, ¡°it is hashish! I know that¡ªby name at least.¡±

¡°That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish¡ªthe purest and most
unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,¡ªthe hashish of Abou-Gor, the
celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a
palace, inscribed with these words, A grateful world to the dealer in
happiness.¡±

¡°Do you know,¡± said Franz, ¡°I have a very great inclination to judge for
myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.¡±

¡°Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin¡ªjudge, but do not confine yourself
to one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a
fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle
in nature against this divine substance,¡ªin nature which is not made for
joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat, the
dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then
the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what changes
occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys
of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but
to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane sphere from your
visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a
Lapland winter¡ªto quit paradise for earth¡ªheaven for hell! Taste the
hashish, guest of mine¡ªtaste the hashish.¡±

Franz¡¯s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous
preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift
it to his mouth.

¡°Diable!¡± he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve. ¡°I do not
know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the thing
does not appear to me as palatable as you say.¡±

¡°Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the
substances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea,
porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did you
like them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants
with assaf?tida, and the Chinese eat swallows¡¯ nests? Eh? no! Well, it
is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world
will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears
to you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the adjoining chamber,
which is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.¡±

They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad¡ªand whom we have
occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title by
which to distinguish him¡ªgave some orders to the servant, Franz entered
still another apartment.

It was simply yet richly furnished. It was round, and a large divan
completely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered
with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there
were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from Bengal;
panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those that
appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway, and
so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so
that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on
the most luxurious bed.

Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes
and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there
was no need to smoke the same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which
Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.

There was a moment¡¯s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to
thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his
conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into
which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to
remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the
smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul. Ali brought in the
coffee.

¡°How do you take it?¡± inquired the unknown; ¡°in the French or Turkish
style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling? As you please; it
is ready in all ways.¡±

¡°I will take it in the Turkish style,¡± replied Franz.

¡°And you are right,¡± said his host; ¡°it shows you have a tendency for an
Oriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men who know how
to live. As for me,¡± he added, with one of those singular smiles which
did not escape the young man, ¡°when I have completed my affairs in
Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me
again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.¡±

20087m


¡°Ma foi,¡± said Franz, ¡°it would be the easiest thing in the world; for I
feel eagle¡¯s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings I
could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.¡±

¡°Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your wings,
and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over
you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we
are here to ease your fall.¡±

He then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience
and withdrew, but not to any distance.

As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the
bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the
events of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the
first approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be
aware of the coming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy
lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses
seemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it
was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before
he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue
of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the
summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors,¡ªsongs so
clear and sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their
notes been taken down,¡ªhe saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a
threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the
desert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an
enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had
decreed to attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended
there to build a city.

At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock,
as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains
of most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to descend,
several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be
supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes
as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and
he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular
host, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and
become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic
lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of
statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch
in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.

They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with
eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair. They
were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.
Then among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the
midst of Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those
soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble
wantons.

Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and
approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in
their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves,
and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints
withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the
serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him
in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.

It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him
saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream
of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone
turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to
Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a
sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to
his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The
more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses
yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his
very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath
the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the enchantment of his
marvellous dream.






Chapter 32. The Waking

When Franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He
thought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity
scarcely penetrated. He stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he
rose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of
dry heather, very soft and odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if
the statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at his
waking.

He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and
to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality. He
found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a
kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and water were
shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were
sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was
at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.

There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his
brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left
against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some
time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the
things of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this
view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the
illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He recalled
his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a
subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a
spoonful of hashish.

It seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a
year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the
impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it
taken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid
the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the
shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses. Otherwise, his
head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from the
slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of
lightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the bright
sunshine more vividly than ever.

He went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him;
and the patron, accosting him, said:

¡°The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and
desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his
leave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important
business calls him to Malaga.¡±

¡°So, then, Gaetano,¡± said Franz, ¡°this is, then, all reality; there
exists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right
royally, and has departed while I was asleep?¡±

¡°He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her
sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all
probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.¡±

So saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was
making sail towards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his
telescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.
At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the
shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he had
been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his
guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his
handkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud
of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as
it expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.

¡°There, do you hear?¡± observed Gaetano; ¡°he is bidding you adieu.¡±

The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any
idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the
yacht from the shore.

¡°What are your excellency¡¯s orders?¡± inquired Gaetano.

¡°In the first place, light me a torch.¡±

¡°Ah, yes, I understand,¡± replied the patron, ¡°to find the entrance to
the enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it
would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too
have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has
come over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,¡±
he added, ¡°and give it to his excellency.¡±

Giovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean
grotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had awaked
by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he carried
his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw nothing,
unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the
same thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave a foot of this
granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he
did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword
into it, or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the
hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he lost two hours in his
attempts, which were at last utterly useless. At the end of this time he
gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.

When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a
small white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass, but
even then he could not distinguish anything.

Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats,
which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and began to
hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty,
rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour
he had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild and agile
as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz could not
consider them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling,
occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he had really been the
hero of one of the tales of the Thousand and One Nights, and he was
irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.

Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,
after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second visit
was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast
ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous
evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw
the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her flight
towards Corsica.

¡°Why,¡± he remarked to Gaetano, ¡°you told me that Signor Sinbad was going
to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of Porto-Vecchio.¡±

¡°Don¡¯t you remember,¡± said the patron, ¡°I told you that among the crew
there were two Corsican brigands?¡±

¡°True; and he is going to land them,¡± added Franz.

¡°Precisely so,¡± replied Gaetano. ¡°Ah, he is one who fears neither God
nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his
course to do a poor devil a service.¡±

20093m


¡°But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of
the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,¡± said
Franz.

¡°And what cares he for that,¡± replied Gaetano with a laugh, ¡°or any
authorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him! Why, in the
first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any
frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on
the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?¡±

It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz¡¯s host, had the
honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along
the whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional
privileges. As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at
Monte Cristo. He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the
grotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being
ready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way. At the moment
the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it
disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio. With it was effaced the last
trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish,
statues,¡ªall became a dream for Franz.

The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun
rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo.

When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment
at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his
affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he
should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.

He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane
by the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained
beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini¡¯s hotel. But
this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with
people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur
which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events
in every year,¡ªthe Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of
St. Peter.

All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy,
between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station
between this world and the next¡ªa sublime spot, a resting-place full of
poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six
times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.

At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually
increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.
On his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to
hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there
was no room for him at the H?tel de Londres. Then he sent his card to
Signor Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan succeeded;
and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made
his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from
the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to
lead him to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.

The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms
looked on to the street¡ªa fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as
an inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very
rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the
host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller
belonged.

¡°Very good, signor Pastrini,¡± said Franz; ¡°but we must have some supper
instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.¡±

¡°As to supper,¡± replied the landlord, ¡°you shall be served immediately;
but as for the carriage¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What as to the carriage?¡± exclaimed Albert. ¡°Come, come, Signor
Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± replied the host, ¡°we will do all in our power to procure you
one¡ªthis is all I can say.¡±

¡°And when shall we know?¡± inquired Franz.

¡°Tomorrow morning,¡± answered the innkeeper.

¡°Oh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, that¡¯s all, I see plainly
enough. At Drake¡¯s or Aaron¡¯s one pays twenty-five lire for common days,
and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast days;
add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and there¡¯s
an end of it.¡±

¡°I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a
carriage.¡±

¡°Then they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the
journey, but that¡¯s no matter.¡±

¡°There are no horses.¡±

Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not
understand.

¡°Do you understand that, my dear Franz¡ªno horses?¡± he said, ¡°but can¡¯t
we have post-horses?¡±

¡°They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but
those absolutely requisite for posting.¡±

¡°What are we to say to this?¡± asked Franz.

¡°I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I am
accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is supper
ready, Signor Pastrini?¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency.¡±

¡°Well, then, let us sup.¡±

¡°But the carriage and horses?¡± said Franz.

¡°Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a
question of how much shall be charged for them.¡± Morcerf then, with that
delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full
purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly, and
dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six
horses.






Chapter 33. Roman Bandits

The next morning Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The
sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.

¡°Well, excellency,¡± said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting
for Franz to question him, ¡°I feared yesterday, when I would not promise
you anything, that you were too late¡ªthere is not a single carriage to
be had¡ªthat is, for the three last days¡±

¡°Yes,¡± returned Franz, ¡°for the very three days it is most needed.¡±

¡°What is the matter?¡± said Albert, entering; ¡°no carriage to be had?¡±

¡°Just so,¡± returned Franz, ¡°you have guessed it.¡±

¡°Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.¡±

¡°That is to say, excellency,¡± replied Pastrini, who was desirous of
keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the eyes
of his guest, ¡°that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday to
Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you
please.¡±

¡°Ah, that is something,¡± said Albert; ¡°today is Thursday, and who knows
what may arrive between this and Sunday?¡±

¡°Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,¡± replied Franz, ¡°which
will make it still more difficult.¡±

¡°My friend,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°let us enjoy the present without gloomy
forebodings for the future.¡±

¡°At least we can have a window?¡±

¡°Where?¡±

¡°In the Corso.¡±

¡°Ah, a window!¡± exclaimed Signor Pastrini,¡ª¡°utterly impossible; there
was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has
been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.¡±

The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.

¡°Well,¡± said Franz to Albert, ¡°do you know what is the best thing we can
do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining
gondolas if we cannot have carriages.¡±

¡°Ah, the devil, no,¡± cried Albert; ¡°I came to Rome to see the Carnival,
and I will, though I see it on stilts.¡±

¡°Bravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster
pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete
success.¡±

¡°Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday
morning?¡±

¡°Parbleu!¡± said Albert, ¡°do you think we are going to run about on foot
in the streets of Rome, like lawyers¡¯ clerks?¡±

¡°I hasten to comply with your excellencies¡¯ wishes; only, I tell you
beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.¡±

¡°And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next
apartments,¡± said Franz, ¡°I warn you, that as I have been four times
before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you
twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you
will make a good profit.¡±

¡°But, excellency¡±¡ªsaid Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.

¡°Now go,¡± returned Franz, ¡°or I shall go myself and bargain with your
affettatore, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has
plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of
me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will lose
the preference, and that will be your fault.¡±

¡°Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,¡± returned Signor
Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he
confesses defeat; ¡°I will do all I can, and I hope you will be
satisfied.¡±

¡°And now we understand each other.¡±

¡°When do you wish the carriage to be here?¡±

¡°In an hour.¡±

¡°In an hour it will be at the door.¡±

An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance
which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the
occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have
thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of
the Carnival.

¡°Excellency,¡± cried the cicerone, seeing Franz approach the window,
¡°shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?¡±

Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse
was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz was
the ¡°excellency,¡± the vehicle was the ¡°carriage,¡± and the H?tel de
Londres was the ¡°palace.¡± The genius for laudation characteristic of the
race was in that phrase.

Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their
excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the cicerone sprang
into the seat behind.

¡°Where do your excellencies wish to go?¡± asked he.

¡°To Saint Peter¡¯s first, and then to the Colosseum,¡± returned Albert.
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peter¡¯s, and a
month to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peter¡¯s alone.

Suddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch¡ªit
was half-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz
ordered the coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the
Colosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter¡¯s by daylight.
When we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same
pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.

He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall,
and re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the
Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on
the Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of
Antoninus and Faustina, and the Via Sacra.

They sat down to dinner. Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet; he
gave them a tolerable repast. At the end of the dinner he entered in
person. Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and began
accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted.

¡°Excellency,¡± said Pastrini, ¡°I am delighted to have your approbation,
but it was not for that I came.¡±

¡°Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?¡± asked Albert,
lighting his cigar.

¡°No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer;
at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot
be done, there is an end of it.¡±

¡°It is much more convenient at Paris,¡ªwhen anything cannot be done, you
pay double, and it is done directly.¡±

¡°That is what all the French say,¡± returned Signor Pastrini, somewhat
piqued; ¡°for that reason, I do not understand why they travel.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair
on its hind legs, ¡°only madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their
walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Caf¨¦ de Paris.¡±

It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street,
appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the
only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good
terms with its waiters.

Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was
musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.

¡°But,¡± said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host¡¯s meditations, ¡°you
had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know what it was?¡±

20099m


¡°Ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o¡¯clock precisely?¡±

¡°I have.¡±

¡°You intend visiting Il Colosseo.¡±

¡°You mean the Colosseum?¡±

¡°It is the same thing. You have told your coachman to leave the city by
the Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the
Porta San Giovanni?¡±

¡°These are my words exactly.¡±

¡°Well, this route is impossible.¡±

¡°Impossible!¡±

¡°Very dangerous, to say the least.¡±

¡°Dangerous!¡ªand why?¡±

¡°On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.¡±

¡°Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?¡± inquired Albert; ¡°he may be
very famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris.¡±

¡°What! do you not know him?¡±

¡°I have not that honor.¡±

¡°You have never heard his name?¡±

¡°Never.¡±

¡°Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the
Gasparones were mere children.¡±

¡°Now then, Albert,¡± cried Franz, ¡°here is a bandit for you at last.¡±

¡°I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word of
what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin. ¡®Once upon a
time¡ª¡ª¡¯ Well, go on.¡±

Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more
reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,¡ªhe had had a great many
Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.

¡°Excellency,¡± said he gravely, addressing Franz, ¡°if you look upon me as
a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your interest
I¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,¡± said Franz, ¡°but
that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,¡ªbut I will
believe all you say; so proceed.¡±

¡°But if your excellency doubt my veracity¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Signor Pastrini,¡± returned Franz, ¡°you are more susceptible than
Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while you,
at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience. Come, sit
down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.¡±

¡°I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had
since the days of Mastrilla.¡±

¡°Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the
coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by
the Porta San Giovanni?¡±

20101m


¡°This,¡± replied Signor Pastrini, ¡°that you will go out by one, but I
very much doubt your returning by the other.¡±

¡°Why?¡± asked Franz.

¡°Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the gates.¡±

¡°On your honor, is that true?¡± cried Albert.

¡°Count,¡± returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert¡¯s repeated doubts of
the truth of his assertions, ¡°I do not say this to you, but to your
companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to
be laughed at.¡±

¡°My dear fellow,¡± said Albert, turning to Franz, ¡°here is an admirable
adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and
double-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him¡ªwe
bring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who
asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a
carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,
and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and
proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their
country.¡±

Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini¡¯s face assumed an
expression impossible to describe.

¡°And pray,¡± asked Franz, ¡°where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and
other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?¡±

¡°Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my
hunting-knife. And you?¡±

¡°I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.¡±

¡°Do you know, Signor Pastrini,¡± said Albert, lighting a second cigar at
the first, ¡°that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that
it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.¡±

Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he
only answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the only
one likely to listen with attention. ¡°Your excellency knows that it is
not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.¡±

¡°What!¡± cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being
plundered tamely, ¡°not make any resistance!¡±

¡°No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen bandits
who spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces at
you?¡±

¡°Eh, parbleu!¡ªthey should kill me.¡±

The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, ¡°Your
friend is decidedly mad.¡±

¡°My dear Albert,¡± returned Franz, ¡°your answer is sublime, and worthy
the ¡®Let him die,¡¯ of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer, the
safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify a
whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a
motive.¡±

Albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma Christi, which he sipped at
intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.

¡°Well, Signor Pastrini,¡± said Franz, ¡°now that my companion is quieted,
and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this
Luigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?¡ªyoung or old?¡ªtall or
short? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like Jean
Sbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.¡±

¡°You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these
points, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell into
his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,
recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a
present of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.¡±

¡°Let us see the watch,¡± said Albert.

Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Br¨¦guet, bearing the
name of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count¡¯s coronet.

¡°Here it is,¡± said he.

¡°Peste!¡± returned Albert, ¡°I compliment you on it; I have its fellow¡±¡ªhe
took his watch from his waistcoat pocket¡ª¡°and it cost me 3,000 francs.¡±

¡°Let us hear the history,¡± said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to seat
himself.

¡°Your excellencies permit it?¡± asked the host.

¡°Pardieu!¡± cried Albert, ¡°you are not a preacher, to remain standing!¡±

The host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,
which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know
concerning Luigi Vampa.

¡°You tell me,¡± said Franz, at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to
open his mouth, ¡°that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a child¡ªhe is
still a young man, then?¡±

¡°A young man? he is only two-and-twenty;¡ªhe will gain himself a
reputation.¡±

¡°What do you think of that, Albert?¡ªat two-and-twenty to be thus
famous?¡±

¡°Yes, and at his age, Alexander, C?sar, and Napoleon, who have all made
some noise in the world, were quite behind him.¡±

¡°So,¡± continued Franz, ¡°the hero of this history is only two-and-
twenty?¡±

¡°Scarcely so much.¡±

¡°Is he tall or short?¡±

¡°Of the middle height¡ªabout the same stature as his excellency,¡±
returned the host, pointing to Albert.

¡°Thanks for the comparison,¡± said Albert, with a bow.

¡°Go on, Signor Pastrini,¡± continued Franz, smiling at his friend¡¯s
susceptibility. ¡°To what class of society does he belong?¡±

¡°He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,
situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at
Pampinara, and entered the count¡¯s service when he was five years old;
his father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by
the wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the
little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he
was seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to
be taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his
flock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet
too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was called
Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and that then
he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be short, and that
he must profit as much as possible by it. The child accepted joyfully.
Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from
Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o¡¯clock in the morning, the
priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and the little
shepherd took his lesson out of the priest¡¯s breviary. At the end of
three months he had learned to read. This was not enough¡ªhe must now
learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three
alphabets¡ªone large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out to him
that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a
slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the flock was
safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina,
took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a sort of stylus.
The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began. At
the end of three months he had learned to write. The curate, astonished
at his quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper,
and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but nothing compared to the
first; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the
stylus. The curate related the incident to the Count of San-Felice, who
sent for the little shepherd, made him read and write before him,
ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics, and to give him
two piastres a month. With this, Luigi purchased books and pencils. He
applied his imitative powers to everything, and, like Giotto, when
young, he drew on his slate sheep, houses, and trees. Then, with his
knife, he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood; it was thus that
Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had commenced.

20105m


¡°A girl of six or seven¡ªthat is, a little younger than Vampa¡ªtended
sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone
and was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,
let their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed
together; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice¡¯s flock
from those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their
respective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they
kept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and
Teresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself. Beside
his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as he could
in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness and
enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic. None
of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able to
gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His
disposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make
them) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a look,
a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded beneath the
hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken,
but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and gay, but
coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received every month
from the Count of San-Felice¡¯s steward, and the price of all the little
carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in ear-rings, necklaces,
and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her friend¡¯s generosity, Teresa
was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near Rome.

¡°The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each
other, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different
characters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their
conversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an
army, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly
attired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they
had thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated
their flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the
reality of their humble position.

¡°One day the young shepherd told the count¡¯s steward that he had seen a
wolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The
steward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an
excellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the
precision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,
and had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a
sculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what
change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a
fresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or
twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be farther
from his thoughts.

¡°For a long time a gun had been the young man¡¯s greatest ambition. In
every country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the
first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once
renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner
terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all his
leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon; he
purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a mark¡ªthe
trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the Sabine
mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion;
the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon became so
expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report,
and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased,
with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.

20107m


¡°One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were
usually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he
was dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his
shoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi
considerable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds
admirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the
strongest, and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around; and
although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of
the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known
that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people had never
declared their affection; they had grown together like two trees whose
roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose intermingled
perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each other had
become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a day¡¯s
separation.

¡°Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of
brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be
much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from the
neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief
presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.

¡°The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the
kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed
the Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the
Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of
followers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom
he hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and
Pampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much
disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto. After
some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the most
extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of
him.

¡°One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of
Frosinone. The bandit¡¯s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first to
him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is
abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When
their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is sent
to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger;
should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably lost. The
young girl¡¯s lover was in Cucumetto¡¯s troop; his name was Carlini. When
she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and
believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too
well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a favorite with
Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he
had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down,
he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took Cucumetto one side,
while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in
the centre of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to
hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits. There he told the
chief all¡ªhis affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual
fidelity, and how every night, since he had been near, they had met in
some neighboring ruins.

20109m


¡°It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village,
so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting. Cucumetto had
been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had carried the maiden
off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in Rita¡¯s favor, as
her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom. Cucumetto seemed to
yield to his friend¡¯s entreaties, and bade him find a shepherd to send
to Rita¡¯s father at Frosinone.

¡°Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding
her write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her
ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours¡¯ delay was all
that was granted¡ªthat is, until nine the next morning. The instant the
letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to find
a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The natural
messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city
and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy undertook
the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an hour.
Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the joyful
intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the
provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye
vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.

¡°He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter. A
cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end. He
repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a glass
filled with Orvietto, saying, ¡®To the health of the brave Cucumetto and
the fair Rita.¡¯ At this moment Carlini heard a woman¡¯s cry; he divined
the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of him who
presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came. After a
hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found Rita
senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini, Cucumetto
rose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each other for a
moment¡ªthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips, the other
with the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle between the two
men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carlini¡¯s features relaxed, his
hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt, fell to his
side. Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ said Cucumetto, ¡®have you executed your commission?¡¯

¡°¡®Yes, captain,¡¯ returned Carlini. ¡®At nine o¡¯clock tomorrow Rita¡¯s
father will be here with the money.¡¯

¡°¡®It is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young
girl is charming, and does credit to your taste. Now, as I am not
egotistical, we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.¡¯

¡°¡®You have determined, then, to abandon her to the common law?¡¯ said
Carlini.

¡°¡®Why should an exception be made in her favor?¡¯

¡°¡®I thought that my entreaties¡ª¡ª¡¯

¡°¡®What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an exception?¡¯

¡°¡®It is true.¡¯

¡°¡®But never mind,¡¯ continued Cucumetto, laughing, ¡®sooner or later your
turn will come.¡¯ Carlini¡¯s teeth clenched convulsively.

¡°¡®Now, then,¡¯ said Cucumetto, advancing towards the other bandits, ¡®are
you coming?¡¯

¡°¡®I follow you.¡¯

20111m


¡°Cucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for, doubtless, he
feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing betrayed a
hostile design on Carlini¡¯s part. He was standing, his arms folded, near
Rita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a moment the young
man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this mattered little
to him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three hundred
piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared
little about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade; but, to
his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself.

¡°¡®Let us draw lots! let us draw lots!¡¯ cried all the brigands, when they
saw the chief.

¡°Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of
acquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,
and the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of
all, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the
band drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio. He
was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and
to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large
wound, extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.
Diavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud
laugh.

¡°¡®Captain,¡¯ said he, ¡®just now Carlini would not drink your health when
I proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let us see if he will be
more condescending to you than to me.¡¯

¡°Everyone expected an explosion on Carlini¡¯s part; but to their great
surprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and
filling it,¡ª

¡°¡®Your health, Diavolaccio,¡¯ said he calmly, and he drank it off,
without his hand trembling in the least. Then sitting down by the fire,
¡®My supper,¡¯ said he; ¡®my expedition has given me an appetite.¡¯

¡°¡®Well done, Carlini!¡¯ cried the brigands; ¡®that is acting like a good
fellow;¡¯ and they all formed a circle round the fire, while Diavolaccio
disappeared.

¡°Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits looked on
with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps.
They turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his
arms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the ground. As they
entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the firelight, the
unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio. This apparition
was so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with the exception of
Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank calmly. Diavolaccio
advanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid Rita at the
captain¡¯s feet. Then everyone could understand the cause of the
unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit. A knife was plunged
up to the hilt in Rita¡¯s left breast. Everyone looked at Carlini; the
sheath at his belt was empty.

¡°¡®Ah, ah,¡¯ said the chief, ¡®I now understand why Carlini stayed behind.¡¯

¡°All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed. No other of the bandits
would, perhaps, have done the same; but they all understood what Carlini
had done.

¡°¡®Now, then,¡¯ cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and approaching the
corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols, ¡®does anyone dispute
the possession of this woman with me?¡¯

¡°¡®No,¡¯ returned the chief, ¡®she is thine.¡¯

¡°Carlini raised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle of
firelight. Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the bandits
wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the fire. At
midnight the sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all were on the
alert. It was Rita¡¯s father, who brought his daughter¡¯s ransom in
person.

¡°¡®Here,¡¯ said he, to Cucumetto, ¡®here are three hundred piastres; give
me back my child.

¡°But the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him to follow.
The old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees, through whose
branches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at last, and pointed
to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.

¡°¡®There,¡¯ said he, ¡®demand thy child of Carlini; he will tell thee what
has become of her;¡¯ and he returned to his companions.

¡°The old man remained motionless; he felt that some great and unforeseen
misfortune hung over his head. At length he advanced toward the group,
the meaning of which he could not comprehend. As he approached, Carlini
raised his head, and the forms of two persons became visible to the old
man¡¯s eyes. A woman lay on the ground, her head resting on the knees of
a man, who was seated by her; as he raised his head, the woman¡¯s face
became visible. The old man recognized his child, and Carlini recognized
the old man.

¡°¡®I expected thee,¡¯ said the bandit to Rita¡¯s father.

¡°¡®Wretch!¡¯ returned the old man, ¡®what hast thou done?¡¯ and he gazed
with terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife buried in her bosom. A ray
of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of the
dead.

¡°¡®Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,¡¯ said the bandit; ¡®I loved her,
therefore I slew her; for she would have served as the sport of the
whole band.¡¯ The old man spoke not, and grew pale as death. ¡®Now,¡¯
continued Carlini, ¡®if I have done wrongly, avenge her;¡¯ and withdrawing
the knife from the wound in Rita¡¯s bosom, he held it out to the old man
with one hand, while with the other he tore open his vest.

¡°¡®Thou hast done well!¡¯ returned the old man in a hoarse voice; ¡®embrace
me, my son.¡¯

20115m


Carlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his
mistress¡¯s father. These were the first tears the man of blood had ever
wept.

¡°¡®Now,¡¯ said the old man, ¡®aid me to bury my child.¡¯ Carlini fetched two
pickaxes; and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a
huge oak, beneath which the young girl was to repose. When the grave was
formed, the father embraced her first, and then the lover; afterwards,
one taking the head, the other the feet, they placed her in the grave.
Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and said the prayers of the
dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the earth over the corpse,
until the grave was filled. Then, extending his hand, the old man said;
¡®I thank you, my son; and now leave me alone.¡¯

¡°¡®Yet¡ª¡ª¡¯ replied Carlini.

¡°¡®Leave me, I command you.¡¯

¡°Carlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak, and
soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved the
night before to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak,
Cucumetto aroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini would
not quit the forest, without knowing what had become of Rita¡¯s father.
He went toward the place where he had left him. He found the old man
suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his
daughter¡¯s grave. He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead
body of the one and the tomb of the other. But he was unable to complete
this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the Roman
carbineers, Carlini was killed. There was some surprise, however, that,
as he was with his face to the enemy, he should have received a ball
between his shoulders. That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands
remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in
Carlini¡¯s rear when he fell. On the morning of the departure from the
forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness, and heard
this oath of vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.

¡°They told ten other stories of this bandit chief, each more singular
than the other. Thus, from Fondi to Perusia, everyone trembles at the
name of Cucumetto.

¡°These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between
Luigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the
stories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his
good fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not
restore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,
took aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of the
tree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be married
when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age. They were
both orphans, and had only their employers¡¯ leave to ask, which had been
already sought and obtained. One day when they were talking over their
plans for the future, they heard two or three reports of firearms, and
then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near which the two young
persons used to graze their flocks, and hurried towards them. When he
came within hearing, he exclaimed:

¡®I am pursued; can you conceal me?¡¯

¡°They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there is
an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and
the latter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a
word, hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto,
drew it away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there, in a
retreat unknown to everyone, closed the stone upon him, and then went
and resumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four carbineers, on
horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to
be looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner
by the neck. The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side,
saw the young peasants, and galloping up, began to question them. They
had seen no one.

¡°¡®That is very annoying,¡¯ said the brigadier; for the man we are looking
for is the chief.¡¯

¡°¡®Cucumetto?¡¯ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ replied the brigadier; ¡®and as his head is valued at a thousand
Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had
helped us to catch him.¡¯ The two young persons exchanged looks. The
brigadier had a moment¡¯s hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three
thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor
orphans who are going to be married.

¡°¡®Yes, it is very annoying,¡¯ said Vampa; ¡®but we have not seen him.¡¯

¡°Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but in
vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the
stone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he
had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed
the subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of Luigi
and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and he drew
from his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them. But
Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she
thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this
purse of gold.

¡°Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand
instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she
was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing
several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.

¡°Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto. The
time of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a
grand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were
invited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked
permission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be
present amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball
was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter
Carmela, whom he adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of
Teresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the
ball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in her
hair, and gayest glass beads,¡ªshe was in the costume of the women of
Frascati. Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at
holiday time. They both mingled, as they had leave to do, with the
servants and peasants.

¡°The festa was magnificent; not only was the villa brilliantly
illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the
trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the
terraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was
an orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped,
formed quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased.
Carmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered
with pearls, the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle
was of Turkey silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and skirt
were of cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of her
corset were of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one as a
woman of Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four young men
of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that
Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the
world. They were attired as peasants of Albano, Velletri, Civita-
Castellana, and Sora. We need hardly add that these peasant costumes,
like those of the young women, were brilliant with gold and jewels.

¡°Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
Carmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume
similar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice
pointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigi¡¯s arm in a group of
peasants.

¡°¡®Will you allow me, father?¡¯ said Carmela.

¡°¡®Certainly,¡¯ replied the count, ¡®are we not in Carnival time?¡¯

¡°Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her, and
saying a few words to him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young
man looked, bowed in obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited her
to dance in a quadrille directed by the count¡¯s daughter. Teresa felt a
flush pass over her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not refuse his
assent. Luigi slowly relinquished Teresa¡¯s arm, which he had held
beneath his own, and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took
her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille.
Certainly, in the eyes of an artist, the exact and strict costume of
Teresa had a very different character from that of Carmela and her
companions; and Teresa was frivolous and coquettish, and thus the
embroidery and muslins, the cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled her, and
the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain.

¡°Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was
like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through
his whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her
cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon;
every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were
ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly
and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi
could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his
language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning
round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears
ideas of murder and assassination. Then fearing that his paroxysm might
get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree
against which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped
the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which,
unwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to time.

¡°Luigi was jealous!

¡°He felt that, influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition,
Teresa might escape him.

¡°The young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered
herself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;
Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more
potent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all the
honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of San-
Felice¡¯s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not
jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier
led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where Luigi
awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced
at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features
were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from its
sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it was
almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover¡¯s arm. The quadrille had
been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for a
repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of San-Felice
besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.

¡°One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it
was impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had
disappeared.

¡°The truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another
such trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed
Teresa toward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite of
herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young
man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something
strange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt from internal
emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet fully comprehended
that Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she did not know, but yet
she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited.

¡°However, to Teresa¡¯s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not a
word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the
night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the
villa were closed on them for the festa in-doors, he took Teresa quite
away, and as he left her at her home, he said:

¡°¡®Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young
Countess of San-Felice?¡¯

¡°¡®I thought,¡¯ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her
nature, ¡®that I would give half my life for a costume such as she wore.¡¯

¡°¡®And what said your cavalier to you?¡¯

¡°¡®He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had only one word
to say.¡¯

¡°¡®He was right,¡¯ said Luigi. ¡®Do you desire it as ardently as you say?¡¯

¡°¡®Yes.¡¯

¡°¡®Well, then, you shall have it!¡¯

¡°The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but
his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips. As
Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes into
the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite disappeared,
she went into the house with a sigh.

20121m


¡°That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the imprudence
of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights. The Villa of
San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the
lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of the flames, she
sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown, and attempted to
escape by the door, but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was
already a prey to the flames. She then returned to her room, calling for
help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her window, which was twenty
feet from the ground, was opened, a young peasant jumped into the
chamber, seized her in his arms, and with superhuman skill and strength
conveyed her to the turf of the grass-plot, where she fainted. When she
recovered, her father was by her side. All the servants surrounded her,
offering her assistance. An entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but
what of that, as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured?

¡°Her preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was
inquired after, but no one had seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled
that she had not recognized him.

¡°As the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had
run,¡ªand the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that
appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,¡ªthe
loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.

¡°The next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the
borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in
high spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the
previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so
cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to
her when she was not excited or in a passion.

¡°Luigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the
grotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was
something extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly.

¡°¡®Teresa,¡¯ said Luigi, ¡®yesterday evening you told me you would give all
the world to have a costume similar to that of the count¡¯s daughter.¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ replied Teresa with astonishment; ¡®but I was mad to utter such a
wish.¡¯

¡°¡®And I replied, ¡°Very well, you shall have it.¡±¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every
word uttered by Luigi, ¡®but of course your reply was only to please me.¡¯

¡°¡®I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,¡¯ said Luigi
proudly. ¡®Go into the grotto and dress yourself.¡¯

¡°At these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto,
lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid
mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl
necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the
rest of the costume.

¡°Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire
came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a
dressing-room.

¡°Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent
hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on
horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus
presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar
to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put his
horse into a gallop and advanced toward him.

¡°Luigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to
Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a
distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways,
and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he
begged Luigi to be his guide.

¡°Luigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his
shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with
the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up
with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On
arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he
stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was
to follow.

¡°¡®That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.¡¯

¡°¡®And here is your recompense,¡¯ said the traveller, offering the young
herdsman some small pieces of money.

¡°¡®Thank you,¡¯ said Luigi, drawing back his hand; ¡®I render a service, I
do not sell it.¡¯

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ replied the traveller, who seemed used to this difference
between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the
mountaineer, ¡®if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.¡¯

¡°¡®Ah, yes, that is another thing.¡¯

¡°¡®Then,¡¯ said the traveller, ¡®take these two Venetian sequins and give
them to your bride, to make herself a pair of earrings.¡¯

¡°¡®And then do you take this poniard,¡¯ said the young herdsman; ¡®you will
not find one better carved between Albano and Civita-Castellana.¡¯

¡°¡®I accept it,¡¯ answered the traveller, ¡®but then the obligation will be
on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.¡¯

¡°¡®For a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it is hardly
worth a piastre.¡¯

¡°¡®What is your name?¡¯ inquired the traveller.

¡°¡®Luigi Vampa,¡¯ replied the shepherd, with the same air as he would have
replied, Alexander, King of Macedon. ¡®And yours?¡¯

¡°¡®I,¡¯ said the traveller, ¡®am called Sinbad the Sailor.¡¯¡±

Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay started with surprise.

¡°Sinbad the Sailor?¡± he said.

¡°Yes,¡± replied the narrator; ¡°that was the name which the traveller gave
to Vampa as his own.¡±

¡°Well, and what may you have to say against this name?¡± inquired Albert;
¡°it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman of that
name amused me very much in my youth, I must confess.¡±

Franz said no more. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be
supposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of
the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening.

¡°Proceed!¡± said he to the host.

¡°Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly
returned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred
paces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know
whence this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he heard
his own name pronounced distinctly.

¡°The cry proceeded from the grotto. He bounded like a chamois, cocking
his carbine as he went, and in a moment reached the summit of a hill
opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller. Three cries
for help came more distinctly to his ear. He cast his eyes around him
and saw a man carrying off Teresa, as Nessus, the centaur, carried
Deianira.

¡°This man, who was hastening towards the wood, was already three-
quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest. Vampa
measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance
of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him. The young shepherd
stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he put the
butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher, followed
him for a second in his track, and then fired.

¡°The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he fell
with Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose instantly, but the man lay
on the earth struggling in the agonies of death. Vampa then rushed
towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed
her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared that
the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his
betrothed.

¡°Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had
overcome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and
unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He had just expired, with
clenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in
the sweat of death. His eyes remained open and menacing. Vampa
approached the corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.

¡°From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young
peasants, he had been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be
his. From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment
when her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he
at length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring
skill of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him
for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the
contrary, Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the slain
ruffian but by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body
over the shoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his
mistress:

¡°¡®Ah,¡¯ said he¡ª¡®good, good! You are dressed; it is now my turn to dress
myself.¡¯

20125m


¡°Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of San-
Felice¡¯s daughter. Vampa took Cucumetto¡¯s body in his arms and conveyed
it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside. If a second
traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,¡ªa shepherdess
watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with ear-rings and
necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of sapphires, emeralds,
and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that he had returned to
the times of Florian, and would have declared, on reaching Paris, that
he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill.

¡°At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto; his
costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore a vest of
garnet-colored velvet, with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat
covered with embroidery; a Roman scarf tied round his neck; a cartridge-
box worked with gold, and red and green silk; sky-blue velvet breeches,
fastened above the knee with diamond buckles; garters of deerskin,
worked with a thousand arabesques, and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all
colors; two watches hung from his girdle, and a splendid poniard was in
his belt.

¡°Teresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a
painting by L¨¦opold Robert or Schnetz. He had assumed the entire costume
of Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed,
and a smile of pride passed over his lips.

¡°¡®Now,¡¯ he said to Teresa, ¡®are you ready to share my fortune, whatever
it may be?¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, yes!¡¯ exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.

¡°¡®And follow me wherever I go?¡¯

¡°¡®To the world¡¯s end.¡¯

¡°¡®Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.¡¯

¡°The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was
conducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,
proud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon
entered it.

¡°We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to
Vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment¡¯s hesitation, although
there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at the trees
and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a
half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the
forest. A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep gorge. Vampa took
this wild road, which, enclosed between two ridges, and shadowed by the
tufted umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the difficulties of its
descent, that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks. Teresa had become
alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her, and
pressed closely against her guide, not uttering a syllable; but as she
saw him advance with even step and composed countenance, she endeavored
to repress her emotion.

¡°Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree
and aimed at Vampa.

¡°¡®Not another step,¡¯ he said, ¡®or you are a dead man.¡¯

¡°¡®What, then,¡¯ said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain,
while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to
him, ¡®do wolves rend each other?¡¯

¡°¡®Who are you?¡¯ inquired the sentinel.

¡°¡®I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.¡¯

¡°¡®What do you want?¡¯

¡°¡®I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca
Bianca.¡¯

¡°¡®Follow me, then,¡¯ said the sentinel; ¡®or, as you know your way, go
first.¡¯

¡°Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit,
went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm and easy
step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to
stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice imitated the
cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.

¡°¡®Good!¡¯ said the sentry, ¡®you may now go on.¡¯

¡°Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung
tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of
carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top
of a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a volcano¡ªan
extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba
to come and found the city of Rome.

¡°Teresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves
in the presence of twenty bandits.

¡°¡®Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,¡¯ said the
sentinel.

¡°¡®What has he to say?¡¯ inquired the young man who was in command in the
chief¡¯s absence.

¡°¡®I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd¡¯s life,¡¯ was Vampa¡¯s
reply.

¡°¡®Ah, I understand,¡¯ said the lieutenant; ¡®and you seek admittance into
our ranks?¡¯

¡°¡®Welcome!¡¯ cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni,
who had recognized Luigi Vampa.

¡°¡®Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.¡¯

¡°¡®And what may that be?¡¯ inquired the bandits with astonishment.

¡°¡®I come to ask to be your captain,¡¯ said the young man.

¡°The bandits shouted with laughter.

¡°¡®And what have you done to aspire to this honor?¡¯ demanded the
lieutenant.

¡°¡®I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set
fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my
betrothed.¡¯

¡°An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto,
deceased.¡±

20129m


¡°Well, my dear Albert,¡± said Franz, turning towards his friend; ¡°what
think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?¡±

¡°I say he is a myth,¡± replied Albert, ¡°and never had an existence.¡±

¡°And what may a myth be?¡± inquired Pastrini.

¡°The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,¡± replied Franz.

¡°And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment
in the environs of Rome?¡±

¡°And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an
example.¡±

¡°Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?¡±

¡°Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the
plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast. They
seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him
on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he
has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio, Giannutri, or Monte
Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at
Albano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.¡±

¡°And how does he behave towards travellers?¡±

¡°Alas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be
from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day
wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows
another hour¡¯s grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money
is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner¡¯s brains with a pistol-
shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the account.¡±

¡°Well, Albert,¡± inquired Franz of his companion, ¡°are you still disposed
to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?¡±

¡°Quite so,¡± said Albert, ¡°if the way be picturesque.¡±

The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.

¡°Excellencies,¡± said he, ¡°the coach is ready.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± said Franz, ¡°let us to the Colosseum.¡±

¡°By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?¡±

¡°By the streets, morbleu! by the streets!¡± cried Franz.

¡°Ah, my dear fellow,¡± said Albert, rising, and lighting his third cigar,
¡°really, I thought you had more courage.¡±

So saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the
carriage.

Chapter 34. The Colosseum

Franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum
they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression
interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building
they came to admire. The road selected was a continuation of the Via
Sistina; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which
stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San
Pietro in Vincoli, the travellers would find themselves directly
opposite the Colosseum.

This itinerary possessed another great advantage,¡ªthat of leaving Franz
at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor
Pastrini¡¯s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so
strangely mixed up. Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage,
he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately
listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of questions
touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving at a
satisfactory reply to any of them.

One fact more than the rest brought his friend ¡°Sinbad the Sailor¡± back
to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that
seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini¡¯s
account of Vampa¡¯s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers
and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found
supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had even
deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the sole
purpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of Monte
Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the H?tel de Londres,
abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his
philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia, Ostia, and
Ga?ta, as on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and further, Franz
bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of
Tunis and Palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle of
acquaintances extended.

But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these
reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark
frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings
of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly
gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage stopped near the
Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting,
found themselves opposite a cicerone, who appeared to have sprung up
from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.

The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two
conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply
of guides; besides the ordinary cicerone, who seizes upon you directly
you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the
city, there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument¡ªnay,
almost to each part of a monument. It may, therefore, be easily imagined
there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum, that wonder of all
ages, which Martial thus eulogizes:

¡°Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and
the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to
the superiority of the gigantic labor of the C?sars, and the many voices
of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable
monument.¡±

As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their
ciceronian tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more
difficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to
visit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the young
men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly
surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.

Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the
Colosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in
his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;
and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity
of the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic
admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these
stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and
more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the
building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a
southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to
light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western
clime.

Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps
beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to
the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of
carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as
regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the
various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,
beginning, as a matter of course, with the ¡°Lions¡¯ Den¡±, the ¡°Hall of
the Gladiators¡± and finishing with ¡°C?sar¡¯s Podium¡±), to escape a jargon
and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded, Franz
ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to follow their
monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column, and
immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a
full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic
ruin.

Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by
the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-
place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his
guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a
vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again
disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the
Vestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades
following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui. All at once his
ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase
opposite the one by which he had himself ascended. There was nothing
remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and
falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell
gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who
endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being
heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.

Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly
visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon
which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery
brightness.

The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like
Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the
frivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing
extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded,
stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took,
convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person.

By a sort of instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible
behind his pillar.

About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof
had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be
seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.

Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free
entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile,
grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood
out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large
masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the
chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.

The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz
stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to
distinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out. He
wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left
shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance,
while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. The
lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays
of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed their
refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished
leather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.

20135m


From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to one
conclusion,¡ªthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged
to no inferior station of life.

Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest
signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture
in the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the
flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly
seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then,
as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass
of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three
or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet. The man
who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the
Transtevere costume.

¡°I beg your excellency¡¯s pardon for keeping you waiting,¡± said the man,
in the Roman dialect, ¡°but I don¡¯t think I¡¯m many minutes after my time,
ten o¡¯clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran.¡±

¡°Say not a word about being late,¡± replied the stranger in purest
Tuscan; ¡°¡¯tis I who am too soon. But even if you had caused me to wait a
little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not
occasioned by any fault of yours.¡±

¡°Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,¡± said the man; ¡°I
came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense
deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.¡±

¡°And who is Beppo?¡±

¡°Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to
let me know what is going on within his holiness¡¯s castle.¡±

¡°Indeed! You are a provident person, I see.¡±

¡°Why, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these days
I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some
little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out
of prison.¡±

¡°Briefly, what did you learn?¡±

¡°That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day
after tomorrow at two o¡¯clock, as is customary at Rome at the
commencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be
mazzolato;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who
brought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer
is sentenced to be decapitato;4 and he, your excellency, is poor
Peppino.¡±

¡°The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical government,
but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that they are
glad of all opportunity of making an example.¡±

¡°But Peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor
shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.¡±

¡°Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But mark
the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on
the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply
sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the
day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every
spectator.¡±

¡°Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise
them with.¡±

¡°My good friend,¡± said the man in the cloak, ¡°excuse me for saying that
you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant
act.¡±

¡°Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop at
nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this scrape
solely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself as a
coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.¡±

¡°And what do you mean to do?¡±

¡°To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal
from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution,
and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and
carry off the prisoner.¡±

¡°That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my
scheme is far better than yours.¡±

¡°And what is your excellency¡¯s project?¡±

¡°Just this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the
person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino;
and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will
afford him the means of escaping from his prison.¡±

¡°And do you feel sure of succeeding?¡±

¡°Pardieu!¡± exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing himself
in French.

¡°What did your excellency say?¡± inquired the other.

¡°I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the means
of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,
pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act,
and have no fears for the result.¡±

¡°At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness,
in case your excellency should fail.¡±

¡°None whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any
satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I
seek.¡±

¡°Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that
you have but one day to work in.¡±

¡°And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each
hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty
seconds? Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.¡±

¡°And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.¡±

¡°Oh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower
windows at the Caf¨¦ Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon
for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks,
and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.¡±

¡°And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing
the execution?¡±

¡°Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will give it
to him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold
itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer, who, in
his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it will be
as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it be
only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in
either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.¡±

¡°Your excellency,¡± said the man, ¡°you are fully persuaded of my entire
devotion to you, are you not?¡±

¡°Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,¡± replied the
cavalier in the cloak.

¡°Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and
henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute
obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render
to another.¡±

¡°Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may
remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period,
when I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.¡±

¡°Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what I
have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of
the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may
regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Hush!¡± interrupted the stranger; ¡°I hear a noise.¡±

¡°¡¯Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight.¡±

¡°¡¯Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing
but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be
honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our
intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit
would suffer thereby.¡±

¡°Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?¡±

¡°The middle window at the Caf¨¦ Rospoli will be hung with white damask,
bearing a red cross.¡±

¡°And if you fail?¡±

¡°Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.¡±

¡°And then?¡±

¡°And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and I
further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.¡±

¡°We understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;
depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.¡±

Saying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase,
while his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in
the folds of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to
the arena by an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard
himself called by Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the
sound of his friend¡¯s name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons
till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had
overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them
in his descent. In ten minutes after the strangers had departed, Franz
was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied
indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the
manner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to
prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.

Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear
what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that
had occurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the
Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to
him, but not so the other; and though Franz had been unable to
distinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or
obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an
impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to
forget them, hear them when or where he might. It was more especially
when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that
Franz¡¯s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched
voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he
heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the
Colosseum. And the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction,
that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host
and entertainer, ¡°Sinbad the Sailor.¡±

20139m


Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to
resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage,
and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but
in the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he
had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at
such a time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen, therefore,
he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition,
but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance
should chance afford him another opportunity.

In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which
assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber
refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish
contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the
identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant
of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew
his opinion on the subject.

Worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till
late. Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in
arranging for the evening¡¯s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at
the Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,
relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.

At five o¡¯clock Albert returned, delighted with his day¡¯s work; he had
been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received
in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible
for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the
remarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had accomplished what
his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect.
Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played
that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers appeared in
it. The opera of Parisina was announced for representation, and the
principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia.

The young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in
having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer
of Lucia di Lammermoor, supported by three of the most renowned
vocalists of Italy.

Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their
orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of
balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who
had had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the
Opera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and
effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his
elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy
representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying
reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a
single adventure.

Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but
internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to
think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of
any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have
his labor for his pains. And the thing was so much the more annoying,
as, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had
quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself
in Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should
astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-
affairs.

Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his way;
the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if
not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of
changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all
he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this
advantage over those of France, that they are faithful even in their
infidelity.

Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there
might be an exception to the general rule.

Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also
possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a
viscount¡ªa recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is
not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a
genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or
merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf
commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to
render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was
therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the
principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling
observation.

Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and
indifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the
different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated,
Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual
rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this time
of liberty and relaxation. The Carnival was to commence on the morrow;
therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the
programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.

With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of
the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by
the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet. The box taken by Albert
was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is
deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled
the ¡°nobility¡¯s boxes,¡± and although the box engaged for the two friends
was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had
cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one
admitting merely four occupants.

Another motive had influenced Albert¡¯s selection of his seat,¡ªwho knew
but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the
notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would
procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely
balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?

These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to
please than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of
the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the
beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas,
this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had
been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures,
into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much
engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that
they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.

The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the
¡°Holy Week¡± that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to
prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the
stage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought
of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly cease
their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to listen to
some brilliant effort of Moriani¡¯s, a well-executed recitative by
Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of La
Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed into
their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation.

Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been
hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been
introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The
quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend
beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily:

¡°Do you know the woman who has just entered that box?¡±

¡°Yes; what do you think of her?¡±

¡°Oh, she is perfectly lovely¡ªwhat a complexion! And such magnificent
hair! Is she French?¡±

¡°No; a Venetian.¡±

¡°And her name is¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Countess G¡ª¡ª.¡±

¡°Ah, I know her by name!¡± exclaimed Albert; ¡°she is said to possess as
much wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been presented to her
when I met her at Madame Villefort¡¯s ball.¡±

¡°Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?¡± asked Franz.

¡°My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to
venture to take me to her box?¡±

¡°Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing
with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an
acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.¡±

At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her
hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the
head. ¡°Upon my word,¡± said Albert, ¡°you seem to be on excellent terms
with the beautiful countess.¡±

¡°You are mistaken in thinking so,¡± returned Franz calmly; ¡°but you
merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to
commit the most egregious blunders,¡ªI mean that of judging the habits
and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe me,
nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of
intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms
they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between
ourselves and the countess¡ªnothing more.¡±

¡°Is there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of
heart?¡±

¡°No; of taste,¡± continued Franz gravely.

¡°And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?¡±

¡°By the countess¡¯s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last night, by
moonlight, and nearly alone.¡±

¡°You were with her, then?¡±

¡°I was.¡±

¡°And what did you say to her?¡±

¡°Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is
a glorious monument!¡±

¡°Upon my word,¡± cried Albert, ¡°you must have been a very entertaining
companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a
place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to
talk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a
chance, the living should be my theme.¡±

20143m


¡°And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, ¡°never mind the
past; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep your
promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?¡±

¡°Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.¡±

¡°What a confounded long time this first act lasts. I believe, on my
soul, that they never mean to finish it.¡±

¡°Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How
exquisitely Coselli sings his part.¡±

¡°But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.¡±

¡°Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see anything
more perfect than her acting?¡±

¡°Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to Malibran
and Sontag, such singers as these don¡¯t make the same impression on you
they perhaps do on others.¡±

¡°At least, you must admire Moriani¡¯s style and execution.¡±

¡°I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a
voice like a woman¡¯s.¡±

¡°My good friend,¡± said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to
point his glass at every box in the theatre, ¡°you seem determined not to
approve; you are really too difficult to please.¡±

The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite
satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly
passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands,
and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way.

Franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a
gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard
the gratification of Albert¡¯s eager impatience, but began at once the
tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed himself of
the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to
settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the
lappets of his coat. This important task was just completed as they
arrived at the countess¡¯s box.

At the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who was
seated beside the countess, in obedience to the Italian custom,
instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in turn,
would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.

Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the
day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents;
nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in which
the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of
perfection. Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having
been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her
sojourn in Paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested
him (Franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box,
and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it
upon himself to do so.

The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her
hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the
vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if
he wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own
chair.

Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian
matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew
there. Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and,
unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up
Albert¡¯s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.

Sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated
on the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek
costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore
it, was her national attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the
outline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage
it was not possible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear breaking in
upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the
countess and Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the
fair Albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of
being observed by either sex.

¡°All I can tell about her,¡± replied the countess, ¡°is, that she has been
at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her where she now
sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has never
missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is
now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black servant.¡±

¡°And what do you think of her personal appearance?¡±

¡°Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely¡ªshe is just my idea of what Medora
must have been.¡±

Franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed
her conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous
survey of the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which
was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably
arranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself
a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the
choreographic art¡ªone of those masterly productions of grace, method,
and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet, from the principal
dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at
the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting
the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous
movement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of
volition, influenced the moving mass.

The ballet was called Poliska.

However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too
deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while
she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her
eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference
of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never
even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the
trumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the
orchestra. Of this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might
be trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams.

The ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the
loud, unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.

Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera
with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the
singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their
costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their
pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.

The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the
leader¡¯s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise
and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to
him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she
became as absorbed as before in what was going on.

The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so
completely in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could
not distinguish a single feature. The curtain rose, and the attention of
Franz was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box
containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the
business of the stage.

Most of my readers are aware that the second act of Parisina opens with
the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while sleeping,
betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured husband goes
through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction seizes on his
mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he awakens his
guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with
his vengeance.

This duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible
conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.
Franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly
expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give
vent to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul
of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it.
Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience,
and was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but
suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the
half-uttered ¡°bravos¡± expired on his lips.

The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share
the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand
up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no
difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte
Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding
evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had
seemed so familiar to him.

All doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host evidently
resided at Rome. The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full
confirmation of Franz¡¯s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a
corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing
with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and
begged to know what had happened.

¡°Countess,¡± returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery, ¡°I asked you
a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the Albanian
lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her
husband?¡±

¡°Nay,¡± answered the countess, ¡°I know no more of him than yourself.¡±

¡°Perhaps you never before noticed him?¡±

¡°What a question¡ªso truly French! Do you not know that we Italians have
eyes only for the man we love?¡±

¡°True,¡± replied Franz.

¡°All I can say is,¡± continued the countess, taking up the lorgnette, and
directing it toward the box in question, ¡°that the gentleman, whose
history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been
dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-
digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours,
than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!¡±

¡°Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,¡± said Franz.

¡°Then you know him?¡± almost screamed the countess. ¡°Oh, pray do, for
heaven¡¯s sake, tell us all about¡ªis he a vampire, or a resuscitated
corpse, or what?¡±

¡°I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.¡±

¡°And I can well understand,¡± said the countess, shrugging up her
beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through her
veins, ¡°that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to
forget him.¡±

The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to
himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same
unaccountable awe and misgiving.

¡°Well.¡± inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time directed
her lorgnette at the box, ¡°what do you think of our opposite neighbor?¡±

20147m


¡°Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.¡±

This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franz¡¯s countenance;
although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief
in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as
the mysterious personage before him.

¡°I must positively find out who and what he is,¡± said Franz, rising from
his seat.

¡°No, no,¡± cried the countess; ¡°you must not leave me. I depend upon you
to escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.¡±

¡°Is it possible,¡± whispered Franz, ¡°that you entertain any fear?¡±

¡°I¡¯ll tell you,¡± answered the countess. ¡°Byron had the most perfect
belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me that he had
seen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the
features and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact
personification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,
large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems
burning,¡ªthe same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the woman
with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a
foreigner¡ªa stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes from.
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like
himself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near
him¡ªat least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as
great, pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can
nor shall. For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.¡±

Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day,
for many reasons.

¡°Listen to me,¡± said the countess, ¡°and do not be so very headstrong. I
am going home. I have a party at my house tonight, and therefore cannot
possibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I cannot for one instant
believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when
she even condescends to ask you for it.¡±

There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat, open
the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite
evident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz
himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread¡ªso much the
stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative
recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an
instinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she
had listened to till she believed them truths. Franz could even feel her
arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage. Upon arriving at her
hotel, Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of
expecting company; on the contrary, her own return before the appointed
hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants.

¡°Excuse my little subterfuge,¡± said the countess, in reply to her
companion¡¯s half-reproachful observation on the subject; ¡°but that
horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be
alone, that I might compose my startled mind.¡±

Franz essayed to smile.

¡°Nay,¡± said she, ¡°do not smile; it ill accords with the expression of
your countenance, and I am sure it does not spring from your heart.
However, promise me one thing.¡±

¡°What is it?¡±

¡°Promise me, I say.¡±

¡°I will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination of
finding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine
for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is
going.¡±

¡°Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where he
is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.¡±

¡°Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,¡± said Franz.

¡°Well, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to your
hotel, and make no attempt to follow this man tonight. There are certain
affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards. For
heaven¡¯s sake, do not serve as a conductor between that man and me.
Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please; but never
bring him near me, if you would not see me die of terror. And now, good-
night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away all recollections of this
evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I shall not be able to close
my eyes.¡±

So saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide
whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her
fears and agitations were genuine.

Upon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown
and slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.

¡°My dear fellow!¡± cried he, springing up, ¡°is it really you? Why, I did
not expect to see you before tomorrow.¡±

¡°My dear Albert,¡± replied Franz, ¡°I am glad of this opportunity to tell
you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion
concerning Italian women. I should have thought the continual failures
you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you
better by this time.¡±

¡°Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them
aright. Why, here¡ªthey give you their hand¡ªthey press yours in
return¡ªthey keep up a whispering conversation¡ªpermit you to accompany
them home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these
marks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.¡±

¡°And the very reason why the women of this fine country, ¡®where sounds
the si,¡¯ as Dante writes, put so little restraint on their words and
actions, is because they live so much in public, and have really nothing
to conceal. Besides, you must have perceived that the countess was
really alarmed.¡±

¡°At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to
us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my part, I met
them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me, if I
can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I can
assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking
fellow¡ªadmirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of his
clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor¡ªprobably Blin or
Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know, paleness
is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and
distinguished breeding.¡±

Franz smiled; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided
himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion.

¡°Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,¡± said Franz, ¡°that the
countess¡¯s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. Did he
speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?¡±

¡°I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that from
the mixture of Greek words. I don¡¯t know whether I ever told you that
when I was at college I was rather¡ªrather strong in Greek.¡±

¡°He spoke the Romaic language, did he?¡±

¡°I think so.¡±

¡°That settles it,¡± murmured Franz. ¡°¡¯Tis he, past all doubt.¡±

¡°What do you say?¡±

¡°Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I came
in?¡±

¡°Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.¡±

¡°Indeed. Of what nature?¡±

¡°Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.¡±

¡°Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means
afforded to endeavor to get one.¡±

¡°Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my
brain.¡±

Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the
suggestions of his imagination.

¡°I tell you what, M. Franz,¡± cried Albert, ¡°you deserve to be called out
for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to
bestow on me just now.¡±

¡°And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your
scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.¡±

¡°Well, then, hearken to me.¡±

¡°I listen.¡±

¡°You agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the
question?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°Neither can we procure horses?¡±

¡°True; we have offered any sum, but have failed.¡±

¡°Well, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might be
had.¡±

¡°Very possibly.¡±

¡°And a pair of oxen?¡±

¡°As easily found as the cart.¡±

¡°Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our
business can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if
you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a
striking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by L¨¦opold
Robert. It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us
in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group would
then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite
beautiful enough to represent a Madonna.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Franz, ¡°this time, M. Albert, I am bound to give you credit
for having hit upon a most capital idea.¡±

¡°And quite a national one, too,¡± replied Albert with gratified pride. ¡°A
mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye Romans! you
thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your
processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are
to be had in your beggarly city. But you don¡¯t know us; when we can¡¯t
have one thing we invent another.¡±

¡°And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?¡±

¡°Only to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then
explained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing
would be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry
for; when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me there
would not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so you see
we must do without this little superfluity.¡±

¡°And where is he now?¡±

¡°Who?¡±

¡°Our host.¡±

¡°Gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.¡±

¡°Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.¡±

¡°Oh, I expect him every minute.¡±

At this instant the door opened, and the head of Signor Pastrini
appeared. ¡°Permesso?¡± inquired he.

¡°Certainly¡ªcertainly,¡± cried Franz. ¡°Come in, my host.¡±

¡°Now, then,¡± asked Albert eagerly, ¡°have you found the desired cart and
oxen?¡±

¡°Better than that!¡± replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a man
perfectly well satisfied with himself.

¡°Take care, my worthy host,¡± said Albert, ¡°better is a sure enemy to
well.¡±

¡°Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,¡± returned Signor
Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.

¡°But what have you done?¡± asked Franz. ¡°Speak out, there¡¯s a worthy
fellow.¡±

¡°Your excellencies are aware,¡± responded the landlord, swelling with
importance, ¡°that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor
with yourselves!¡±

¡°I should think we did know it,¡± exclaimed Albert, ¡°since it is owing to
that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like two
poor students in the back streets of Paris.¡±

¡°When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which
you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two
places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.¡± The friends looked at
each other with unutterable surprise.

¡°But do you think,¡± asked Albert, ¡°that we ought to accept such offers
from a perfect stranger?¡±

¡°What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?¡± asked Franz of his
host.

¡°A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot exactly
say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold
mine.¡±

¡°It seems to me,¡± said Franz, speaking in an undertone to Albert, ¡°that
if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would
have conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted
it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He would have
written¡ªor¡ª¡ª¡±

At this instant someone knocked at the door.

¡°Come in,¡± said Franz.

A servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared
at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord¡¯s hands, who
forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said:

¡°Please to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte
Albert de Morcerf and M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,¡±
continued the servant, ¡°begs these gentlemen¡¯s permission to wait upon
them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what
time they will please to receive him.¡±

¡°Faith, Franz,¡± whispered Albert, ¡°there is not much to find fault with
here.¡±

¡°Tell the count,¡± replied Franz, ¡°that we will do ourselves the pleasure
of calling on him.¡±

The servant bowed and retired.

¡°That is what I call an elegant mode of attack,¡± said Albert, ¡°You were
quite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count of Monte
Cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of
the world.¡±

¡°Then you accept his offer?¡± said the host.

¡°Of course we do,¡± replied Albert. ¡°Still, I must own I am sorry to be
obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers¡ªit would have
produced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo
Rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, I
don¡¯t know but what I should have held on by my original plan. What say
you, Franz?¡±

¡°Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided
me.¡±

The truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli had
recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding
evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and
the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to
obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled-up
individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as the person
he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to
establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting
him with perfect facility and freedom.

Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he
had already had with his mysterious tormentor, and in waking
speculations as to what the morrow would produce. The next day must
clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend,
the Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring of Gyges, and by its power
was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain he could not
escape this time.

Eight o¡¯clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the
same motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. The first act
of Franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his
accustomed obsequiousness.

¡°Pray, Signor Pastrini,¡± asked Franz, ¡°is not some execution appointed
to take place today?¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may
procure a window to view it from, you are much too late.¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± answered Franz, ¡°I had no such intention; and even if I had
felt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so from Monte
Pincio; could I not?¡±

¡°Ah!¡± exclaimed mine host, ¡°I did not think it likely your excellency
would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected
on that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively belonging to
themselves.¡±

¡°Very possibly I may not go,¡± answered Franz; ¡°but in case I feel
disposed, give me some particulars of today¡¯s executions.¡±

¡°What particulars would your excellency like to hear?¡±

¡°Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and
description of the death they are to die.¡±

¡°That happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago they
brought me the tavolettas.¡±

¡°What are they?¡±

¡°Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening
before an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the names
of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The
reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and
faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate
culprits, and, above all, beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere
repentance.¡±

¡°And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to
those of the faithful, are they?¡± asked Franz somewhat incredulously.

¡°Oh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybody¡¯s affairs
but my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an agreement
with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he
would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should
like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information
concerning the time and place etc.¡±

¡°Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, Signor
Pastrini,¡± cried Franz.

¡°Why, your excellency,¡± returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing his
hands with infinite complacency, ¡°I think I may take upon myself to say
I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble
visitors to this poor hotel.¡±

¡°I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely
upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests
wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these
tavolettas.¡±

¡°Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency¡¯s wish,¡± said
the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; ¡°I have caused one to be
placed on the landing, close by your apartment.¡±

Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read
as follows:

¡°¡®The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd, being the
first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza del
Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named
Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former
found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named
Don C¨¦sar Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the
latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary
bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will be
mazzolato, the second culprit decapitato.

¡°¡®The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate
men, that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt,
and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes.¡¯¡±

This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins
of the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,¡ªthe names of the
condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed with
his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the
Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the
man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as ¡°Sinbad the Sailor,¡±
but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in
Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.

Time was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken
Albert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his
friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated
delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his
pillow long before his usual hour.

¡°Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,¡± said Franz, addressing his
landlord, ¡°since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once
to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°Most assuredly,¡± replied he. ¡°The Count of Monte Cristo is always an
early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.¡±

¡°Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our
respects to him directly?¡±

20155m


¡°Oh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you find I
have led you into an error.¡±

¡°Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?¡±

¡°Perfectly.¡±

¡°Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.¡±

¡°Yes, let us do so.¡±

The landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all that
separated them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell, and,
upon the door being opened by a servant, said:

¡°I signori Francesi.¡±

The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed
through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected
to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into an
elegantly fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered the
floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and
sofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired
repose or refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters were
ranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies of war,
while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the
different doors of the room.

¡°If your excellencies will please to be seated,¡± said the man, ¡°I will
let the count know that you are here.¡±

And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried
porti¨¨res. As the door opened, the sound of a guzla reached the ears of
the young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid closing of
the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter. Franz and
Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous
furnishings of the apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a
second view than it had done at their first rapid survey.

¡°Well,¡± said Franz to his friend, ¡°what think you of all this?¡±

¡°Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and
attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has
speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling
incog.¡±

¡°Hush, hush!¡± replied Franz; ¡°we shall ascertain who and what he is¡ªhe
comes!¡±

As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and
almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the
owner of all these riches stood before the two young men. Albert
instantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound
on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he
recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the
occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary
host of Monte Cristo.

Chapter 35. La Mazzolata

Gentlemen,¡± said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, ¡°I pray you
excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to
disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides,
you sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at
your disposal.¡±

¡°Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,¡± returned
Albert; ¡°you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the
point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly
invitation reached us.¡±

¡°Indeed,¡± returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.
¡°It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did not sooner
assist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of your
embarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am, I
seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As
soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized
the opportunity of offering my services.¡±

The two young men bowed. Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had
come to no determination, and as nothing in the count¡¯s manner
manifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know
whether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more
proof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the
previous evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the man
he had seen at the Colosseum. He resolved, therefore, to let things take
their course without making any direct overture to the count. Moreover,
he had this advantage, he was master of the count¡¯s secret, while the
count had no hold on Franz, who had nothing to conceal. However, he
resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly
clear up his doubts.

¡°Count,¡± said he, ¡°you have offered us places in your carriage, and at
your windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where we can obtain
a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, ¡°is
there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point he
wished.

¡°Stay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps I
can render you this slight service also.¡±

He extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.

¡°Did you ever occupy yourself,¡± said he to Franz, ¡°with the employment
of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants? I
have. When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo;
thrice, for my steward,¡ªthus I do not waste a minute or a word. Here he
is.¡±

A man of about forty-five or fifty entered, exactly resembling the
smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern; but he did not appear
to recognize him. It was evident he had his orders.

¡°Monsieur Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°you have procured me windows
looking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.¡±

¡°Yes, excellency,¡± returned the steward; ¡°but it was very late.¡±

¡°Did I not tell you I wished for one?¡± replied the count, frowning.

¡°And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I
was obliged to pay a hundred¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°That will do¡ªthat will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen
all such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is sufficient.
Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs to
conduct us to it.¡±

The steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.

¡°Ah!¡± continued the count, ¡°be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has
received the tavoletta, and if he can send us an account of the
execution.¡±

¡°There is no need to do that,¡± said Franz, taking out his tablets; ¡°for
I saw the account, and copied it down.¡±

¡°Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer. Let us
know when breakfast is ready. These gentlemen,¡± added he, turning to the
two friends, ¡°will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?¡±

¡°But, my dear count,¡± said Albert, ¡°we shall abuse your kindness.¡±

¡°Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You will,
one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.
Bertuccio, lay covers for three.¡±

He then took Franz¡¯s tablets out of his hand. ¡°¡®We announce,¡¯ he read,
in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper, ¡®that today,
the 23rd of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murder
on the person of the respected and venerated Don C¨¦sar Torlini, canon of
the church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca Priori,
convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa, and the
men of his band.¡¯

¡°Hum! ¡®The first will be mazzolato, the second decapitato.¡¯ Yes,¡±
continued the count, ¡°it was at first arranged in this way; but I think
since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the
ceremony.¡±

¡°Really?¡± said Franz.

¡°Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi¡¯s, and there
mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.¡±

¡°For Andrea Rondolo?¡± asked Franz.

¡°No,¡± replied the count, carelessly; ¡°for the other (he glanced at the
tablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called Rocca Priori. You
are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the mazzolata still
remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first
time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is very
simple. The manda?a6 never fails, never trembles, never strikes thirty
times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais,
and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the
sufferer. Ah,¡± added the count, in a contemptuous tone, ¡°do not tell me
of European punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the old age,
of cruelty.¡±

¡°Really, count,¡± replied Franz, ¡°one would think that you had studied
the different tortures of all the nations of the world.¡±

¡°There are, at least, few that I have not seen,¡± said the count coldly.

¡°And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?¡±

¡°My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third
curiosity.¡±

¡°Curiosity¡ªthat is a terrible word.¡±

¡°Why so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then,
curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part;
and how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and even
the different customs of their countries, different persons bear the
transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation? As for
myself, I can assure you of one thing,¡ªthe more men you see die, the
easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a
torture, but it is not an expiation.¡±

¡°I do not quite understand you,¡± replied Franz; ¡°pray explain your
meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.¡±

¡°Listen,¡± said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the
blood would to the face of any other. ¡°If a man had by unheard-of and
excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your
betrothed,¡ªa being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound
that never closes, in your breast,¡ªdo you think the reparation that
society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the
guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of
the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings
to escape with a few moments of physical pain?¡±

¡°Yes, I know,¡± said Franz, ¡°that human justice is insufficient to
console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but you
must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.¡±

¡°I will put another case to you,¡± continued the count; ¡°that where
society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death. But
are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer
without society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him
even the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?
Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers
of the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are
inadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do
not these crimes exist?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± answered Franz; ¡°and it is to punish them that duelling is
tolerated.¡±

¡°Ah, duelling,¡± cried the count; ¡°a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of
arriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man has carried off
your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your
daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to
expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to
everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you
think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass
a sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your
brain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is
often he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime
in the eyes of the world. No, no,¡± continued the count, ¡°had I to avenge
myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.¡±

¡°Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?¡± asked
Albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.

¡°Oh, yes,¡± replied the count; ¡°understand me, I would fight a duel for a
trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my
skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have
gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man. Oh, I
would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound,
eternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible; an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,¡ªour masters in
everything,¡ªthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a
life of dreams and a paradise of realities.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Franz to the count, ¡°with this theory, which renders you at
once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to
adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power
of the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out
vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.¡±

¡°Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful;
besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of
which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic French
Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken
on the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged? On
my word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino
will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then of
seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is worth
even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation for
the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I recollect, you asked
for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit down
to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is
ready.¡±

As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment,
saying:

¡°Al suo commodo!¡±

The two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.

During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked
repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he
doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but
whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to
him, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to
duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew of
had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did
not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who
for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of
Italian cookery¡ªthat is, the worst in the world.

As for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the
duties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their
departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food. This
brought back to Franz, in spite of himself, the recollection of the
terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G¡ª¡ª, and her firm
conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire.

At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.

¡°Well,¡± said the count, ¡°what are you doing?¡±

¡°You must excuse us, count,¡± returned Franz, ¡°but we have still much to
do.¡±

¡°What may that be?¡±

¡°We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.¡±

¡°Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room in
the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose brought
to us, and you can dress there.¡±

¡°After the execution?¡± cried Franz.

¡°Before or after, whichever you please.¡±

¡°Opposite the scaffold?¡±

¡°The scaffold forms part of the f¨ºte.¡±

¡°Count, I have reflected on the matter,¡± said Franz, ¡°I thank you for
your courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your
carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you at
liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.¡±

¡°But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,¡± returned the
count.

¡°You will describe it to me,¡± replied Franz, ¡°and the recital from your
lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it. I
have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never
been able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?¡±

¡°I,¡± replied the viscount,¡ª¡°I saw Castaing executed, but I think I was
rather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same morning,
and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.¡±

¡°Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at
Paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is
to see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are asked,
¡®How do they execute at Rome?¡¯ and you reply, ¡®I do not know!¡¯ And,
besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who killed
with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own
son. Diable! when a churchman is killed, it should be with a different
weapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a father. If you
went to Spain, would you not see the bull-fights? Well, suppose it is a
bull-fight you are going to see? Recollect the ancient Romans of the
Circus, and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a
hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators, the
sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming Vestals who made
with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said, ¡®Come,
despatch the dying.¡¯¡±

¡°Shall you go, then, Albert?¡± asked Franz.

¡°Ma foi, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count¡¯s eloquence decides
me.¡±

¡°Let us go, then,¡± said Franz, ¡°since you wish it; but on our way to the
Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is this possible,
count?¡±

¡°On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.¡±

¡°I will go on foot, then.¡±

¡°Is it important that you should go that way?¡±

¡°Yes, there is something I wish to see.¡±

¡°Well, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait for us
on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be glad to
pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have given have
been executed.¡±

¡°Excellency,¡± said a servant, opening the door, ¡°a man in the dress of a
penitent wishes to speak to you.¡±

¡°Ah! yes,¡± returned the count, ¡°I know who he is, gentlemen; will you
return to the salon? you will find good cigars on the centre table. I
will be with you directly.¡±

The young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again
apologizing, left by another door. Albert, who was a great smoker, and
who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of
the Caf¨¦ de Paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at
perceiving some veritable puros.

¡°Well,¡± asked Franz, ¡°what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°What do I think?¡± said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question
from his companion; ¡°I think he is a delightful fellow, who does the
honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,
like Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,¡± added he, sending a
volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, ¡°that he has excellent cigars.¡±

Such was Albert¡¯s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that
Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection,
he made no attempt to change it.

¡°But,¡± said he, ¡°did you observe one very singular thing?¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°How attentively he looked at you.¡±

¡°At me?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

Albert reflected. ¡°Ah,¡± replied he, sighing, ¡°that is not very
surprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and my
clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a
provincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and
tell him I am nothing of the kind.¡±

Franz smiled; an instant after the count entered.

¡°I am now quite at your service, gentlemen,¡± said he. ¡°The carriage is
going one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go another; and, if
you please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars, M. de
Morcerf.¡±

¡°With all my heart,¡± returned Albert; ¡°Italian cigars are horrible. When
you come to Paris, I will return all this.¡±

¡°I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow me, I
will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is half-
past twelve¡ªlet us set off.¡±

All three descended; the coachman received his master¡¯s orders, and
drove down the Via del Babuino. While the three gentlemen walked along
the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina, which led directly between
the Fiano and Rospoli palaces, Franz¡¯s attention was directed towards
the windows of that last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal
agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant.

¡°Which are your windows?¡± asked he of the count, with as much
indifference as he could assume.

¡°The three last,¡± returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected,
for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.

Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows. The side windows were
hung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red
cross. The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin,
and there could now be no doubt that he was the count.

The three windows were still untenanted. Preparations were making on
every side; chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were
hung with flags. The masks could not appear; the carriages could not
move about; but the masks were visible behind the windows, the
carriages, and the doors.

Franz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they
approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and above
the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,
surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in
front of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del Babuino,
del Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold,
between which glittered the curved knife of the manda?a.

At the corner of the street they met the count¡¯s steward, who was
awaiting his master. The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the
count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the second
floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino and the
Monte Pincio. It consisted, as we have said, of a small dressing-room,
opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of communication was shut,
the inmates were quite alone. On chairs were laid elegant masquerade
costumes of blue and white satin.

20167m


¡°As you left the choice of your costumes to me,¡± said the count to the
two friends, ¡°I have had these brought, as they will be the most worn
this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the confetti
(sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.¡±

Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did
not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was
wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented,
and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.

It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,¡ªwe say
guillotine, because the Roman manda?a is formed on almost the same model
as the French instrument.7 The knife, which is shaped like a crescent,
that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and that is
all the difference.

Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were
eating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal. Their repast
consisted apparently of bread and sausages. One of them lifted the
plank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his
companion. These two men were the executioner¡¯s assistants.

At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.

The prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove
to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night,
each accompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating, before
which were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals. A double line
of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the church, reached to
the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving a path about ten
feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet.

All the rest of the square was paved with heads. Many women held their
infants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view. The
Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the
balconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and
the Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti-colored
sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall held
its living statue. What the count said was true¡ªthe most curious
spectacle in life is that of death.

And yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the
occasion, laughter and jests arose from the crowd. It was evident that
the execution was, in the eyes of the people, only the commencement of
the Carnival.

Suddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church
opened. A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes
of gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands
lighted tapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head.

20169m


Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was
naked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which
hung a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a
heavy iron sledge-hammer.

This man was the executioner.

He had, moreover, sandals bound on his feet by cords.

Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die,
first Peppino and then Andrea. Each was accompanied by two priests.
Neither had his eyes bandaged.

Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him.
Andrea was supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time,
kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them.

At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him. He looked at
Albert¡ªhe was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his
cigar, although he had not half smoked it. The count alone seemed
unmoved¡ªnay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale
cheeks. His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its
prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and
sharp like those of a jackal. And yet his features wore an expression of
smiling tenderness, such as Franz had never before witnessed in them;
his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.

However, the two culprits advanced, and as they approached their faces
became visible. Peppino was a handsome young man of four or five-and-
twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect, and seemed on the
watch to see on which side his liberator would appear. Andrea was short
and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did not indicate age;
he might be thirty. In prison he had suffered his beard to grow; his
head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath him, and his movements
were apparently automatic and unconscious.

¡°I thought,¡± said Franz to the count, ¡°that you told me there would be
but one execution.¡±

¡°I told you true,¡± replied he coldly.

¡°And yet here are two culprits.¡±

¡°Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many
years to live.¡±

¡°If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.¡±

¡°And see, here it is,¡± said the count. At the moment when Peppino
reached the foot of the manda?a, a priest arrived in some haste, forced
his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the
brotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had
noticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his
hand, ¡°Heaven be praised, and his Holiness also,¡± said he in a loud
voice; ¡°here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!¡±

¡°A pardon!¡± cried the people with one voice; ¡°a pardon!¡±

At this cry Andrea raised his head.

¡°Pardon for whom?¡± cried he.

Peppino remained breathless.

¡°A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,¡± said the principal friar.
And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who
read and returned it to him.

¡°For Peppino!¡± cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which
he had been plunged. ¡°Why for him and not for me? We ought to die
together. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right to put
me to death alone. I will not die alone¡ªI will not!¡±

And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast,
and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The
executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold
and seized him.

¡°What is going on?¡± asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was
in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.

¡°Do you not see?¡± returned the count, ¡°that this human creature who is
about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with
him? and, were he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his
teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be
deprived of. Oh, man, man¡ªrace of crocodiles,¡± cried the count,
extending his clenched hands towards the crowd, ¡°how well do I recognize
you there, and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves!¡±

Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground,
and he kept exclaiming, ¡°He ought to die!¡ªhe shall die!¡ªI will not die
alone!¡±

¡°Look, look,¡± cried the count, seizing the young men¡¯s hands; ¡°look, for
on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who had resigned himself to his
fate, who was going to the scaffold to die¡ªlike a coward, it is true,
but he was about to die without resistance. Do you know what gave him
strength? do you know what consoled him? It was, that another partook of
his punishment¡ªthat another partook of his anguish¡ªthat another was to
die before him! Lead two sheep to the butcher¡¯s, two oxen to the
slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his companion will
not die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy.
But man¡ªman, whom God created in his own image¡ªman, upon whom God has
laid his first, his sole commandment, to love his neighbor¡ªman, to whom
God has given a voice to express his thoughts¡ªwhat is his first cry when
he hears his fellow-man is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, this
masterpiece of nature, this king of the creation!¡±

And the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must
have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.

However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness.
The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all
took part against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, ¡°Put him to
death! put him to death!¡±

Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before the
window.

¡°What are you doing?¡± said he. ¡°Do you pity him? If you heard the cry of
¡®Mad dog!¡¯ you would take your gun¡ªyou would unhesitatingly shoot the
poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten by
another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one of
his race, has yet murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to kill
anyone, because his hands are bound, wishes to see his companion in
captivity perish. No, no¡ªlook, look!¡±

20172m


The recommendation was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible
spectacle.

The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and there, in spite
of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced him to his knees.
During this time the executioner had raised his mace, and signed to them
to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise, but, ere he had
time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy sound was
heard, and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over
on his back.

The executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one stroke
opened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently on it
with his feet. At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound.

This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half
fainting, into a seat.

Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the window-curtains.

The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel!






Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome

When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of
water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and
the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced
mechanically towards the piazza¡ªthe scene was wholly changed; scaffold,
executioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained,
full of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only
sounds on the pope¡¯s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was
ringing a joyous peal.

¡°Well,¡± asked he of the count, ¡°what has, then, happened?¡±

¡°Nothing,¡± replied the count; ¡°only, as you see, the Carnival has
commenced. Make haste and dress yourself.¡±

¡°In fact,¡± said Franz, ¡°this horrible scene has passed away like a
dream.¡±

¡°It is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.¡±

¡°Yes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?¡±

¡°That is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have
awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?¡±

¡°But Peppino¡ªwhat has become of him?¡±

¡°Peppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in
proportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general
attention was directed towards his companion. He profited by this
distraction to slip away among the crowd, without even thanking the
worthy priests who accompanied him. Decidedly man is an ungrateful and
egotistical animal. But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you the
example.¡±

Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and
varnished boots.

¡°Well, Albert,¡± said Franz, ¡°do you feel much inclined to join the
revels? Come, answer frankly.¡±

¡°Ma foi, no,¡± returned Albert. ¡°But I am really glad to have seen such a
sight; and I understand what the count said¡ªthat when you have once
habituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the only one that
causes you any emotion.¡±

20175m


¡°Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study
character,¡± said the count; ¡°on the steps of the scaffold death tears
off the mask that has been worn through life, and the real visage is
disclosed. It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome, the
hideous scoundrel! Come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress yourselves.¡±

Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions¡¯
example. He assumed his costume, and fastened on the mask that scarcely
equalled the pallor of his own face. Their toilet finished, they
descended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled with sweetmeats
and bouquets. They fell into the line of carriages.

It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken
place. Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza
del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry. A
crowd of masks flowed in from all sides, emerging from the doors,
descending from the windows. From every street and every corner drove
carriages filled with clowns, harlequins, dominoes, mummers,
pantomimists, Transteverins, knights, and peasants, screaming, fighting,
gesticulating, throwing eggs filled with flour, confetti, nosegays,
attacking, with their sarcasms and their missiles, friends and foes,
companions and strangers, indiscriminately, and no one took offence, or
did anything but laugh.

Franz and Albert were like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow, have
recourse to wine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated, feel a
thick veil drawn between the past and the present. They saw, or rather
continued to see, the image of what they had witnessed; but little by
little the general vertigo seized them, and they felt themselves obliged
to take part in the noise and confusion.

A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which,
while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his
neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred
pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks
around him were engaged. He rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of
confetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them
with all the force and skill he was master of.

20177m


The strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen
half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men¡¯s minds, so
much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now
beheld.

As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant shown any
appearance of having been moved. Imagine the large and splendid Corso,
bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their
balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. At these
balconies are three hundred thousand spectators¡ªRomans, Italians,
strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,
wealth, and genius. Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the
scene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and shower
down confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened
with the falling confetti and flying flowers. In the streets the lively
crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes¡ªgigantic cabbages walk
gravely about, buffaloes¡¯ heads bellow from men¡¯s shoulders, dogs walk
on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted, and, as
in Callot¡¯s Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely face is exhibited, which
we would fain follow, but from which we are separated by troops of
fiends. This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome.

At the second turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested
permission to withdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal. Franz
looked up¡ªthey were opposite the Rospoli Palace. At the centre window,
the one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino,
beneath which Franz¡¯s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of
the Argentina.

¡°Gentlemen,¡± said the count, springing out, ¡°when you are tired of being
actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene, you know you have
places at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my coachman, my
carriage, and my servants.¡±

We have forgotten to mention, that the count¡¯s coachman was attired in a
bear-skin, exactly resembling Odry¡¯s in The Bear and the Pasha; and the
two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring masks,
with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.

Franz thanked the count for his attention. As for Albert, he was busily
occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was
passing near him. Unfortunately for him, the line of carriages moved on
again, and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo, the other ascended
towards the Palazzo di Venezia.

¡°Ah, my dear fellow,¡± said he to Franz; ¡°you did not see?¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°There,¡ªthat calash filled with Roman peasants.¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Well, I am convinced they are all charming women.¡±

¡°How unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,¡± said Franz; ¡°here was an
opportunity of making up for past disappointments.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± replied he, half laughing, half serious; ¡°I hope the Carnival will
not pass without some amends in one shape or the other.¡±

But, in spite of Albert¡¯s hope, the day passed unmarked by any incident,
excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman
peasants. At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely,
Albert¡¯s mask fell off. He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the
bouquets into the carriage. Doubtless one of the charming females Albert
had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his
gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she threw
a bunch of violets. Albert seized it, and as Franz had no reason to
suppose it was meant for him, he suffered Albert to retain it. Albert
placed it in his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly on.

¡°Well,¡± said Franz to him; ¡°there is the beginning of an adventure.¡±

¡°Laugh if you please¡ªI really think so. So I will not abandon this
bouquet.¡±

¡°Pardieu,¡± returned Franz, laughing, ¡°in token of your ingratitude.¡±

The jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when Albert and
Franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini, the one who had
thrown the violets to Albert, clapped her hands when she beheld them in
his button-hole.

¡°Bravo, bravo,¡± said Franz; ¡°things go wonderfully. Shall I leave you?
Perhaps you would prefer being alone?¡±

¡°No,¡± replied he; ¡°I will not be caught like a fool at a first
disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock, as they say at the opera-
balls. If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further, we shall
find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will give me
some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.¡±

¡°On my word,¡± said Franz, ¡°you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as
Ulysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if
she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.¡±

Albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry the
intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more turns,
they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of the
neighboring streets. Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace; but the
count and the blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows, hung
with yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the count
had invited.

At this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the
mascherata sounded the retreat. The file on the Corso broke the line,
and in a second all the carriages had disappeared. Franz and Albert were
opposite the Via delle Muratte; the coachman, without saying a word,
drove up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli Palace
and stopped at the door of the hotel. Signor Pastrini came to the door
to receive his guests.

Franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that he
had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini reassured him by
saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for
himself, and that it had gone at four o¡¯clock to fetch him from the
Rospoli Palace.

The count had, moreover, charged him to offer the two friends the key of
his box at the Argentina. Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions;
but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the
theatre; and instead of making any answer, he inquired if Signor
Pastrini could procure him a tailor.

¡°A tailor,¡± said the host; ¡°and for what?¡±

¡°To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes,¡±
returned Albert.

The host shook his head.

¡°To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow? I ask your
excellencies¡¯ pardon, but this is quite a French demand; for the next
week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six
buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button.¡±

¡°Then I must give up the idea?¡±

¡°No; we have them ready-made. Leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you
awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be
satisfied.¡±

¡°My dear Albert,¡± said Franz, ¡°leave all to our host; he has already
proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards go
and see l¡¯Italienne ¨¤ Alger!

¡°Agreed,¡± returned Albert; ¡°but remember, Signor Pastrini, that both my
friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the
costumes we have asked for.¡±

The host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their
wishes should be attended to; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to
their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their
costumes. Albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the
bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.

The two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from
remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristo¡¯s table and
that of Signor Pastrini. Truth compelled Franz, in spite of the dislike
he seemed to have taken to the count, to confess that the advantage was
not on Pastrini¡¯s side. During dessert, the servant inquired at what
time they wished for the carriage. Albert and Franz looked at each
other, fearing really to abuse the count¡¯s kindness. The servant
understood them.

¡°His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had,¡± he said, ¡°given positive
orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships¡¯ orders all
day, and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of
indiscretion.¡±

They resolved to profit by the count¡¯s courtesy, and ordered the horses
to be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which
they had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats
they had sustained.

20181m


This precaution taken, they went to the theatre, and installed
themselves in the count¡¯s box. During the first act, the Countess G¡ª¡ª
entered. Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the
previous evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of
the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion
to Franz. Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them, that
Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and, availing
himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the Italian
theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two friends went
to pay their respects to the countess. Scarcely had they entered, when
she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor. Albert, in his turn,
sat behind.

¡°Well,¡± said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, ¡°it seems you
have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord
Ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.¡±

¡°Without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,¡± returned
Franz, ¡°I cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.¡±

¡°All day?¡±

¡°Yes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage all
day, and now we have taken possession of his box.¡±

¡°You know him, then?¡±

¡°Yes, and no.¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°It is a long story.¡±

¡°Tell it to me.¡±

¡°It would frighten you too much.¡±

¡°So much the more reason.¡±

¡°At least wait until the story has a conclusion.¡±

¡°Very well; I prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his
acquaintance? Did anyone introduce you to him?¡±

¡°No; it was he who introduced himself to us.¡±

¡°When?¡±

¡°Last night, after we left you.¡±

¡°Through what medium?¡±

¡°The very prosaic one of our landlord.¡±

¡°He is staying, then, at the H?tel de Londres with you?¡±

¡°Not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.¡±

¡°What is his name; for, of course, you know?¡±

¡°The Count of Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°That is not a family name?¡±

¡°No, it is the name of the island he has purchased.¡±

¡°And he is a count?¡±

¡°A Tuscan count.¡±

¡°Well, we must put up with that,¡± said the countess, who was herself
from one of the oldest Venetian families. ¡°What sort of a man is he?¡±

¡°Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf.¡±

¡°You hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,¡± said the countess.

¡°We should be very hard to please, madam,¡± returned Albert, ¡°did we not
think him delightful. A friend of ten years¡¯ standing could not have
done more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.¡±

¡°Come,¡± observed the countess, smiling, ¡°I see my vampire is only some
millionaire, who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid
being confounded with M. de Rothschild; and you have seen her?¡±

¡°Her?¡±

20183m


¡°The beautiful Greek of yesterday.¡±

¡°No; we heard, I think, the sound of her guzla, but she remained
perfectly invisible.¡±

¡°When you say invisible,¡± interrupted Albert, ¡°it is only to keep up the
mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the
white curtains?¡±

¡°Where was this window with white hangings?¡± asked the countess.

¡°At the Rospoli Palace.¡±

¡°The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?¡±

¡°Yes. Did you pass through the Corso?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with
white damask with a red cross? Those were the count¡¯s windows.¡±

¡°Why, he must be a nabob. Do you know what those three windows were
worth?¡±

¡°Two or three hundred Roman crowns?¡±

¡°Two or three thousand.¡±

¡°The deuce!¡±

¡°Does his island produce him such a revenue?¡±

¡°It does not bring him a bajocco.¡±

¡°Then why did he purchase it?¡±

¡°For a whim.¡±

¡°He is an original, then?¡±

¡°In reality,¡± observed Albert, ¡°he seemed to me somewhat eccentric; were
he at Paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, I should say he was a
poor devil literally mad. This morning he made two or three exits worthy
of Didier or Anthony.¡±

At this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz
gave up his seat to him. This circumstance had, moreover, the effect of
changing the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned
to their hotel.

Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the
morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. The
next morning, at nine o¡¯clock, he entered Franz¡¯s room, followed by a
tailor, who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm; they
selected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of
their hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the
long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders
decorate themselves on f¨ºte days.

Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress¡ªa jacket and
breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with buckles,
and a silk waistcoat. This picturesque attire set him off to great
advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and when
his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his shoulder a
stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to
do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations. The Turks
used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but are
they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin, and
their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red
seal? Franz complimented Albert, who looked at himself in the glass with
an unequivocal smile of satisfaction. They were thus engaged when the
Count of Monte Cristo entered.

20185m


¡°Gentlemen,¡± said he, ¡°although a companion is agreeable, perfect
freedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to say that today, and
for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at your
disposal. The host will tell you I have three or four more, so that you
will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of it, I pray you, for
your pleasure or your business.¡±

The young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for
refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte
Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all
subjects with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said,
perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. A glance
at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a
connoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he was
no stranger to the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with chemistry.
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had
given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for
his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini. They told
him so frankly, and he received their excuses with the air of a man who
appreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmed with the count¡¯s manners,
and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman
by reason of his varied knowledge.

The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above
all, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the
preceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing
with them. At half-past one they descended, the coachman and footman had
put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a more
ridiculous appearance than ever, and which gained them the applause of
Franz and Albert. Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his
button-hole. At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the Corso
by the Via Vittoria.

At the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage
filled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his
friend, the peasants had changed their costume also; and whether it was
the result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them
both, while he had donned their costume, they had assumed his.

Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the
faded one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it to
his lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady
who had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as gay as
the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the count
appeared for an instant at his window, but when they again passed he had
disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between
Albert and the fair peasant continued all day.

In the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy,
informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his
holiness the next day. At each previous visit he had made to Rome, he
had solicited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by a
religious feeling as by gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital
of the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet
of one of St. Peter¡¯s successors who has set the rare example of all the
virtues. He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his
condescension and touching kindness, one cannot incline one¡¯s self
without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.

On his return from the Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he
brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad
gayety of the maskers would have been profanation.

At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed. The harlequin had
reassumed her peasant¡¯s costume, and as she passed she raised her mask.
She was charming. Franz congratulated Albert, who received his
congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited.
He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs, that his fair incognita
belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his mind to write to her the
next day.

Franz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed to have
something to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it. He
insisted upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any
sacrifice the other wished.

Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and
then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him
to occupy the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz¡¯s
absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask.
Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of
an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so
flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion
of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as, during
three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a similar piece of
good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was by no means sorry
to learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore promised Albert
that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival
from the windows of the Rospoli Palace.

The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous
bouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous
epistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the
bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a
charming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin.

The evening was no longer joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but
that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated
his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should
pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal. Albert was
not deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly
shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.

¡°Well,¡± said he, ¡°was I mistaken?¡±

¡°She has answered you!¡± cried Franz.

¡°Read.¡±

This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe. Franz took
the letter, and read:

¡°Tuesday evening, at seven o¡¯clock, descend from your carriage opposite
the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your
torch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of San
Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the
shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.
Until then you will not see me. ¡ªConstancy and Discretion.¡±

¡°Well,¡± asked he, when Franz had finished, ¡°what do you think of that?¡±

¡°I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.¡±

¡°I think so, also,¡± replied Albert; ¡°and I very much fear you will go
alone to the Duke of Bracciano¡¯s ball.¡±

Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the
celebrated Roman banker.

¡°Take care, Albert,¡± said Franz. ¡°All the nobility of Rome will be
present, and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of
society, she must go there.¡±

¡°Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,¡± returned
Albert. ¡°You have read the letter?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in
Italy?¡± (This is the name of the lower class.)

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you can,
any blemish in the language or orthography.¡± The writing was, in
reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.

¡°You are born to good fortune,¡± said Franz, as he returned the letter.

¡°Laugh as much as you will,¡± replied Albert, ¡°I am in love.¡±

¡°You alarm me,¡± cried Franz. ¡°I see that I shall not only go alone to
the Duke of Bracciano¡¯s, but also return to Florence alone.¡±

¡°If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,¡± said Albert, ¡°I shall
fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore Rome, and I have
always had a great taste for arch?ology.¡±

20189m


¡°Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing
you a member of the Academy.¡±

Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the
academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready. Albert¡¯s
love had not taken away his appetite. He hastened with Franz to seat
himself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner. After dinner,
the Count of Monte Cristo was announced. They had not seen him for two
days. Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to
Civita Vecchia. He had started the previous evening, and had only
returned an hour since. He was charming. Whether he kept a watch over
himself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords
that in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like
everybody else.

The man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franz
recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any
previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however great Franz¡¯s
desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of being
disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness
prevented him from mentioning it.

The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at
the Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence,
he brought them the key of his own¡ªat least such was the apparent motive
of his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear
of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to
the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if
they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two friends to
accept it.

Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count¡¯s pallor, which had
so forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain from
admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather
the principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic hero!
Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without
imagining his stern head upon Manfred¡¯s shoulders, or beneath Lara¡¯s
helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the
constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem to
penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip
that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses
them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed.

The count was no longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it was
easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he
associated at present. And, to complete his resemblance with the
fantastic heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the power
of fascination. Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune
in meeting such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the count
exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires
over a mind less domineering. He thought several times of the project
the count had of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his
eccentric character, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune,
he would produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish to be at
Paris when the count was there.

The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; that is,
not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing. The
Countess G¡ª¡ª wished to revive the subject of the count, but Franz
announced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of
Albert¡¯s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess of
the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days. As
similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credit
travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, but
congratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating, to
meet at the Duke of Bracciano¡¯s ball, to which all Rome was invited.

The heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of her
existence the morrow or the day after.

At length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the
Carnival. On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o¡¯clock in the morning,
as Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through
want of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival
before, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and
excitement. From two o¡¯clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the
f¨ºte, exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the
pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses¡¯ feet and the carriage
wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.

The f¨ºtes are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of
this history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not
recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those
events so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his
harlequin costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder
almost to the ground. In order that there might be no confusion, Franz
wore his peasant¡¯s costume.

As the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the
pavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was
silent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up of
a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs, oranges,
and nosegays.

At three o¡¯clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the Piazza del
Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the din and
confusion) announced that the races were about to begin.

The races, like the moccoli, are one of the episodes peculiar to the
last days of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages
instantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these
evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous
rapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians
ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and
the clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen
abreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the barberi.
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley of
fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear.

Almost instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry, seven
or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand
spectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo
fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won.

Immediately, without any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing
on towards the Corso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a
while, which again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream
again continued its course between its two granite banks.

A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers
of moccoletti entered on the scene. The moccoli, or moccoletti, are
candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight, and
which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two
very serious problems to grapple with,¡ªfirst, how to keep his own
moccoletto alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the moccoletti of
others. The moccoletto is like life: man has found but one means of
transmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered a
thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.
The moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who can
describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto?¡ªthe
gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.
Everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti¡ªFranz and Albert among the
rest.

The night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of
¡°Moccoletti!¡± repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors, two
or three stars began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At the
end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from the
Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the
Piazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the f¨ºte of
Jack-o¡¯-lanterns.

It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it. Suppose
that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild
dance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied by cries that were
never heard in any other part of the world. The facchino follows the
prince, the Transteverin the citizen, everyone blowing, extinguishing,
relighting. Had old ?olus appeared at this moment, he would have been
proclaimed king of the moccoli, and Aquilo the heir-presumptive to the
throne.

This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours; the Corso was
light as day; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth
stories were visible.

Every five minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to
seven. The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang out,
bearing his moccoletto in his hand. Two or three masks strove to knock
his moccoletto out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate pugilist, sent
them rolling in the street, one after the other, and continued his
course towards the church of San Giacomo.

The steps were crowded with masks, who strove to snatch each other¡¯s
torches. Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him mount the
first step.

Instantly a mask, wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman,
snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance.
Franz was too far off to hear what they said; but, without doubt,
nothing hostile passed, for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the
peasant girl. He watched them pass through the crowd for some time, but
at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello.

Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival
sounded, and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as
if by enchantment. It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had
extinguished everyone.

Franz found himself in utter darkness. No sound was audible save that of
the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was visible
save a few lights that burnt behind the windows.

The Carnival was over.

Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian

In his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden
an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this
moment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of some demon
of the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a chance, which
added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on
the wane, did not rise until eleven o¡¯clock, and the streets which the
young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity.

The distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or
rather the count¡¯s, stopped before the H?tel de Londres.

Dinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not return
so soon, Franz sat down without him. Signor Pastrini, who had been
accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of his
absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the
previous evening an invitation which he had accepted.

The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, the darkness which had replaced
the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil, had left in
Franz¡¯s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness. He
therefore dined very silently, in spite of the officious attention of
his host, who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he
wanted anything.

Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the
carriage, therefore, for eleven o¡¯clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to
inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel.

At eleven o¡¯clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and
went out, telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the
Duke of Bracciano¡¯s. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the
most delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the
Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their
f¨ºtes have a European celebrity.

Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them,
and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts
of his travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the
moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli, and that he had lost
sight of him in the Via Macello.

¡°Then he has not returned?¡± said the duke.

¡°I waited for him until this hour,¡± replied Franz.

¡°And do you know whither he went?¡±

¡°No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a
rendezvous.¡±

¡°Diavolo!¡± said the duke, ¡°this is a bad day, or rather a bad night, to
be out late; is it not, countess?¡±

These words were addressed to the Countess G¡ª¡ª, who had just arrived,
and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the duke¡¯s brother.

¡°I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,¡± replied the
countess, ¡°and those who are here will complain of but one thing, that
of its too rapid flight.¡±

¡°I am not speaking,¡± said the duke with a smile, ¡°of the persons who are
here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you,
and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely; I
meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± asked the countess, ¡°who is out in the streets of Rome at this
hour, unless it be to go to a ball?¡±

¡°Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his
unknown about seven o¡¯clock this evening,¡± said Franz, ¡°and whom I have
not seen since.¡±

¡°And don¡¯t you know where he is?¡±

¡°Not at all.¡±

¡°Is he armed?¡±

¡°He is in masquerade.¡±

¡°You should not have allowed him to go,¡± said the duke to Franz; ¡°you,
who know Rome better than he does.¡±

¡°You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi, who
gained the prize in the race today,¡± replied Franz; ¡°and then moreover,
what could happen to him?¡±

¡°Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via
Macello.¡± Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that
the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his
own personal disquietude.

¡°I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night
here, duke,¡± said Franz, ¡°and desired them to come and inform me of his
return.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± replied the duke, ¡°here I think, is one of my servants who is
seeking you.¡±

The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to
him.

¡°Your excellency,¡± he said, ¡°the master of the H?tel de Londres has sent
to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the
Viscount of Morcerf.¡±

¡°A letter from the viscount!¡± exclaimed Franz.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And who is the man?¡±

¡°I do not know.¡±

¡°Why did he not bring it to me here?¡±

¡°The messenger did not say.¡±

¡°And where is the messenger?¡±

¡°He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± said the countess to Franz, ¡°go with all speed¡ªpoor young man!
Perhaps some accident has happened to him.¡±

¡°I will hasten,¡± replied Franz.

¡°Shall we see you again to give us any information?¡± inquired the
countess.

¡°Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to
what I may do myself.¡±

¡°Be prudent, in any event,¡± said the countess.

¡°Oh! pray be assured of that.¡±

Franz took his hat and went away in haste. He had sent away his carriage
with orders for it to fetch him at two o¡¯clock; fortunately the Palazzo
Bracciano, which is on one side in the Corso, and on the other in the
Square of the Holy Apostles, is hardly ten minutes¡¯ walk from the H?tel
de Londres.

As he came near the hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street.
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was
wrapped up in a large cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme
astonishment, the stranger first addressed him.

¡°What wants your excellency of me?¡± inquired the man, retreating a step
or two, as if to keep on his guard.

¡°Are not you the person who brought me a letter,¡± inquired Franz, ¡°from
the Viscount of Morcerf?¡±

¡°Your excellency lodges at Pastrini¡¯s hotel?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?¡±

¡°I am.¡±

¡°Your excellency¡¯s name¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Is the Baron Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

20199m


¡°Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.¡±

¡°Is there any answer?¡± inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.

¡°Yes¡ªyour friend at least hopes so.¡±

¡°Come upstairs with me, and I will give it to you.¡±

¡°I prefer waiting here,¡± said the messenger, with a smile.

¡°And why?¡±

¡°Your excellency will know when you have read the letter.¡±

¡°Shall I find you here, then?¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

Franz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini.
¡°Well?¡± said the landlord.

¡°Well¡ªwhat?¡± responded Franz.

¡°You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?¡±
he asked of Franz.

¡°Yes, I have seen him,¡± he replied, ¡°and he has handed this letter to
me. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.¡±

The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light.
The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and
this had only made him the more anxious to read Albert¡¯s letter; and so
he went instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written
and signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend
what it contained. It was thus worded:

¡°My dear Fellow,

¡°The moment you have received this, have the kindness to take the letter
of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find in the square drawer
of the secr¨¦taire; add your own to it, if it be not sufficient. Run to
Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand piastres, and give them
to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have this money without delay.
I do not say more, relying on you as you may rely on me.

¡°Your friend,

¡°Albert de Morcerf.

¡°P.S.¡ªI now believe in Italian banditti.¡±

Below these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in
Italian:

¡°Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie
mani, alla sette il Conte Alberto avr¨¤ cessato di vivere.

¡°Luigi Vampa.¡±

¡°If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my
hands, by seven o¡¯clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live.¡±

This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood
the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the
street was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of the
famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time
refused to believe.

There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the secr¨¦taire, and found
the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit. There
were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand Albert had
already expended three thousand.

As to Franz, he had no letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and
had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a
hundred louis, and of these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven
or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum
that Albert required. True, he might in such a case rely on the kindness
of Signor Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the Palazzo
Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed
his mind.

He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for
Signor Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself.

¡°My dear sir,¡± he said, hastily, ¡°do you know if the count is within?¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.¡±

¡°Is he in bed?¡±

¡°I should say no.¡±

¡°Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind as
to give me an audience.¡±

Signor Pastrini did as he was desired, and returning five minutes after,
he said:

¡°The count awaits your excellency.¡±

Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the
count. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which
was surrounded with divans. The count came towards him.

¡°Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?¡± said he; ¡°have you
come to sup with me? It would be very kind of you.¡±

¡°No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.¡±

¡°A serious matter,¡± said the count, looking at Franz with the
earnestness usual to him; ¡°and what may it be?¡±

¡°Are we alone?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave
him Albert¡¯s letter.

¡°Read that,¡± he said.

The count read it.

¡°Well, well!¡± said he.

¡°Did you see the postscript?¡±

¡°I did, indeed.

¡°¡®Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie
mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avr¨¤ cessato di vivere.

¡°¡®Luigi Vampa.¡¯¡±

¡°What think you of that?¡± inquired Franz.

¡°Have you the money he demands?¡±

¡°Yes, all but eight hundred piastres.¡±

The count went to his secr¨¦taire, opened it, and pulling out a drawer
filled with gold, said to Franz, ¡°I hope you will not offend me by
applying to anyone but myself.¡±

¡°You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,¡± replied
Franz.

¡°And I thank you; have what you will;¡± and he made a sign to Franz to
take what he pleased.

¡°Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?¡±
asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.

¡°Judge for yourself,¡± replied he. ¡°The postscript is explicit.¡±

¡°I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could
find a way of simplifying the negotiation,¡± said Franz.

¡°How so?¡± returned the count, with surprise.

¡°If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not refuse
you Albert¡¯s freedom.¡±

¡°What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?¡±

¡°Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?¡±

¡°What is that?¡±

¡°Have you not saved Peppino¡¯s life?¡±

¡°Well, well,¡± said the count, ¡°who told you that?¡±

¡°No matter; I know it.¡± The count knit his brows, and remained silent an
instant.

¡°And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?¡±

¡°If my society would not be disagreeable.¡±

¡°Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us both
good.¡±

¡°Shall I take any arms?¡±

¡°For what purpose?¡±

¡°Any money?¡±

¡°It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?¡±

¡°In the street.¡±

¡°He awaits the answer?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.¡±

¡°It is useless; he would not come up.¡±

¡°To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at
entering mine.¡±

The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the
street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in the mantle quitted
the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street. ¡°Salite!¡± said the
count, in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his
servant. The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation, but rather
with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a bound, entered the hotel;
five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room.

¡°Ah, it is you, Peppino,¡± said the count. But Peppino, instead of
answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count¡¯s hand, and
covered it with kisses. ¡°Ah,¡± said the count, ¡°you have, then, not
forgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week
ago.¡±

20203m


¡°No, excellency; and never shall I forget it,¡± returned Peppino, with an
accent of profound gratitude.

¡°Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.
Rise and answer.¡±

Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz.

¡°Oh, you may speak before his excellency,¡± said he; ¡°he is one of my
friends. You allow me to give you this title?¡± continued the count in
French, ¡°it is necessary to excite this man¡¯s confidence.¡±

¡°You can speak before me,¡± said Franz; ¡°I am a friend of the count¡¯s.¡±

¡°Good!¡± returned Peppino. ¡°I am ready to answer any questions your
excellency may address to me.¡±

¡°How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi¡¯s hands?¡±

¡°Excellency, the Frenchman¡¯s carriage passed several times the one in
which was Teresa.¡±

¡°The chief¡¯s mistress?¡±

¡°Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it¡ªall this
with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.¡±

¡°What?¡± cried Franz, ¡°was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman
peasants?¡±

¡°It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,¡± replied Peppino.

¡°Well?¡± said the count.

¡°Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief¡¯s
consent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa gave
him one¡ªonly, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps of
the church of San Giacomo.¡±

¡°What!¡± exclaimed Franz, ¡°the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto
from him¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Was a lad of fifteen,¡± replied Peppino. ¡°But it was no disgrace to your
friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of others.¡±

¡°And Beppo led him outside the walls?¡± said the count.

¡°Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello. Beppo
got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to be
asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat
by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from
Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the
world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo;
and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became
somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the
coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time, four of the band,
who were concealed on the banks of the Almo, surrounded the carriage.
The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he
could not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield. They made him
get out, walk along the banks of the river, and then brought him to
Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St.
Sebastian.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said the count, turning towards Franz, ¡°it seems to me that this
is a very likely story. What do you say to it?¡±

¡°Why, that I should think it very amusing,¡± replied Franz, ¡°if it had
happened to anyone but poor Albert.¡±

¡°And, in truth, if you had not found me here,¡± said the count, ¡°it might
have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear;
but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious consequence.¡±

¡°And shall we go and find him?¡± inquired Franz.

¡°Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place¡ªdo you know the
catacombs of St. Sebastian?¡±

¡°I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.¡±

¡°Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be
difficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.¡±

¡°Always ready?¡±

¡°Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that sometimes
when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, I
resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.¡±

The count rang, and a footman appeared.

¡°Order out the carriage,¡± he said, ¡°and remove the pistols which are in
the holsters. You need not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.¡±

In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage
stopped at the door. The count took out his watch.

¡°Half-past twelve,¡± he said. ¡°We might start at five o¡¯clock and be in
time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night, and
therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the
hands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?¡±

¡°More determined than ever.¡±

¡°Well, then, come along.¡±

Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the door
they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized
the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the count got
into the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off
at a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and went down the
Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio, and
reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter raised some
difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the
governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of
the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had a
louis for his trouble, and they went on their way.

The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way,
and bordered with tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon,
which began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a
sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat
into the darkness on a signal from Peppino.

A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage
stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count and Franz alighted.

¡°In ten minutes,¡± said the count to his companion, ¡°we shall be there.¡±

He then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and
Peppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the
carriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd
going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface
of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red
herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion.

¡°Now,¡± said the count, ¡°let us follow him.¡±

Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path,
which, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to
the bottom of a small valley. They then perceived two men conversing in
the obscurity.

¡°Ought we to go on?¡± asked Franz of the count; ¡°or should we pause?¡±

¡°Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.¡±

One of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout.
Franz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them.

¡°Your excellency,¡± said Peppino, addressing the count, ¡°if you will
follow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.¡±

¡°Go on, then,¡± replied the count. They came to an opening behind a clump
of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man could
scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they got
along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his
torch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first reached
an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway sloped in a
gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and the count
were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were scarcely able
to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred and fifty
paces in this way, and then were stopped by, ¡°Who comes there?¡± At the
same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel.

¡°A friend!¡± responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry,
he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first,
saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.

Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the
count descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five
corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into
niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins,
showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of the
corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light
were visible. The count laid his hand on Franz¡¯s shoulder.

¡°Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?¡± he inquired.

¡°Exceedingly,¡± replied Franz.

¡°Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.¡± Peppino obeyed, and
Franz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in
advance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out
his torch, was visible along the wall.

They advanced silently, the count guiding Franz as if he had the
singular faculty of seeing in the dark. Franz himself, however, saw his
way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light, which
served in some manner as a guide. Three arcades were before them, and
the middle one was used as a door. These arcades opened on one side into
the corridor where the count and Franz were, and on the other into a
large square chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of
which we have spoken.

In the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly served
as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them.
A lamp, placed at the base of a pillar, lighted up with its pale and
flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes
of the two visitors concealed in the shadow.

A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading
with his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the
new-comers contemplated him. This was the chief of the band, Luigi
Vampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in
their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which
went all round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or more,
each having his carbine within reach. At the other end, silent, scarcely
visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up and down
before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in that spot the
darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere.

When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque
tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent,
and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the
columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced
towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not
hear the noise of his footsteps.

¡°Who comes there?¡± cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who
saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this challenge,
Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle.
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty carbines were
levelled at the count.

¡°Well,¡± said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his
countenance disturbed, ¡°well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you
receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.¡±

20207m


¡°Ground arms,¡± exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand,
while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to
the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, ¡°Your pardon,
your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit,
that I did not really recognize you.¡±

¡°It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,¡± said
the count, ¡°and that not only do you forget people¡¯s faces, but also the
conditions you make with them.¡±

¡°What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?¡± inquired the
bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious
to repair it.

¡°Was it not agreed,¡± asked the count, ¡°that not only my person, but also
that of my friends, should be respected by you?¡±

¡°And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?¡±

¡°You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount
Albert de Morcerf. Well,¡± continued the count, in a tone that made Franz
shudder, ¡°this young gentleman is one of my friends¡ªthis young gentleman
lodges in the same hotel as myself¡ªthis young gentleman has been up and
down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and yet, I repeat
to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither, and,¡± added
the count, taking the letter from his pocket, ¡°you have set a ransom on
him, as if he were an utter stranger.¡±

¡°Why did you not tell me all this¡ªyou?¡± inquired the brigand chief,
turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. ¡°Why have
you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the
count, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens! if I thought one
of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I
would blow his brains out with my own hand!¡±

20211m


¡°Well,¡± said the count, turning towards Franz, ¡°I told you there was
some mistake in this.¡±

¡°Are you not alone?¡± asked Vampa with uneasiness.

¡°I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I
desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your
excellency,¡± the count added, turning to Franz, ¡°here is Luigi Vampa,
who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has
committed.¡±

Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him.

¡°Welcome among us, your excellency,¡± he said to him; ¡°you heard what the
count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for the
four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend¡¯s ransom, that
this had happened.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Franz, looking round him uneasily, ¡°where is the viscount?¡ªI
do not see him.¡±

¡°Nothing has happened to him, I hope,¡± said the count frowningly.

¡°The prisoner is there,¡± replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in
front of which the bandit was on guard, ¡°and I will go myself and tell
him he is free.¡±

The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert¡¯s prison,
and Franz and the count followed him.

¡°What is the prisoner doing?¡± inquired Vampa of the sentinel.

¡°Ma foi, captain,¡± replied the sentry, ¡°I do not know; for the last hour
I have not heard him stir.¡±

¡°Come in, your excellency,¡± said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended
seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened a
door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the
columbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of
the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber.

¡°Come,¡± said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, ¡°not so bad
for a man who is to be shot at seven o¡¯clock tomorrow morning.¡±

Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible
to such a proof of courage.

¡°You are right, your excellency,¡± he said; ¡°this must be one of your
friends.¡±

Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, ¡°Will your
excellency please to awaken?¡±

Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.

¡°Oh,¡± said he, ¡°is it you, captain? You should have allowed me to sleep.
I had such a delightful dream. I was dancing the galop at Torlonia¡¯s
with the Countess G¡ª¡ª.¡± Then he drew his watch from his pocket, that he
might see how time sped.

¡°Half-past one only?¡± said he. ¡°Why the devil do you rouse me at this
hour?¡±

¡°To tell you that you are free, your excellency.¡±

¡°My dear fellow,¡± replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, ¡°remember,
for the future, Napoleon¡¯s maxim, ¡®Never awaken me but for bad news;¡¯ if
you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have been
grateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?¡±

¡°No, your excellency.¡±

¡°Well, then, how am I free?¡±

¡°A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.¡±

¡°Come hither?¡±

¡°Yes, hither.¡±

¡°Really? Then that person is a most amiable person.¡±

Albert looked around and perceived Franz. ¡°What,¡± said he, ¡°is it you,
my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?¡±

¡°No, not I,¡± replied Franz, ¡°but our neighbor, the Count of Monte
Cristo.¡±

¡°Oh, my dear count,¡± said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and
wristbands, ¡°you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me
as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the
carriage, and in the next for this visit,¡± and he put out his hand to
the count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did
give it.

The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently
accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one
whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was
enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in
the presence of the bandit.

¡°My dear Albert,¡± he said, ¡°if you will make haste, we shall yet have
time to finish the night at Torlonia¡¯s. You may conclude your
interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to Signor Luigi, who
has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.¡±

¡°You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o¡¯clock.
Signor Luigi,¡± continued Albert, ¡°is there any formality to fulfil
before I take leave of your excellency?¡±

¡°None, sir,¡± replied the bandit, ¡°you are as free as air.¡±

¡°Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.¡±

And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,
crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.

¡°Peppino,¡± said the brigand chief, ¡°give me the torch.¡±

¡°What are you going to do?¡± inquired the count.

¡°I will show you the way back myself,¡± said the captain; ¡°that is the
least honor that I can render to your excellency.¡±

And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he preceded
his guests, not as a servant who performs an act of civility, but like a
king who precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he bowed.

¡°And now, your excellency,¡± added he, ¡°allow me to repeat my apologies,
and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred.¡±

¡°No, my dear Vampa,¡± replied the count; ¡°besides, you compensate for
your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to
you for having committed them.¡±

20214m


¡°Gentlemen,¡± added the chief, turning towards the young men, ¡°perhaps
the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever
feel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be
welcome.¡±

Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert. Franz
paused for a moment.

¡°Has your excellency anything to ask me?¡± said Vampa with a smile.

¡°Yes, I have,¡± replied Franz; ¡°I am curious to know what work you were
perusing with so much attention as we entered.¡±

¡°C?sar¡¯s Commentaries,¡± said the bandit, ¡°it is my favorite work.¡±

¡°Well, are you coming?¡± asked Albert.

¡°Yes,¡± replied Franz, ¡°here I am,¡± and he, in his turn, left the caves.
They advanced to the plain.

¡°Ah, your pardon,¡± said Albert, turning round; ¡°will you allow me,
captain?¡±

And he lighted his cigar at Vampa¡¯s torch.

¡°Now, my dear count,¡± he said, ¡°let us on with all the speed we may. I
am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano¡¯s.¡±

They found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word in
Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed.

It was just two o¡¯clock by Albert¡¯s watch when the two friends entered
into the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they
entered together, all uneasiness on Albert¡¯s account ceased instantly.

¡°Madame,¡± said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess,
¡°yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am
rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend,
whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the
delay arose from no fault of mine.¡±

And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz,
Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and disappeared with
her in the whirl of dancers.

In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had
passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been, in
some sort, forced to give his hand to Albert.






Chapter 38. The Rendezvous

The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following
morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit
to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked
the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered
could never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted by
some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was
strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be
exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage
seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert¡¯s
request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a
short delay, the count joined them in the salon.

¡°My dear count,¡± said Albert, advancing to meet him, ¡°permit me to
repeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the
remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory;
believe me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with
grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered
me; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.¡±

¡°My very good friend and excellent neighbor,¡± replied the count, with a
smile, ¡°you really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing
but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your
travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between
us;¡ªbut you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and
unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect
indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.¡±

¡°Upon my word,¡± said Albert, ¡°I deserve no credit for what I could not
help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to
let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes
all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile
even in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing
to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in
my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you? My
father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses
considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I
unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my
life is dear, at your disposal.¡±

¡°Monsieur de Morcerf,¡± replied the count, ¡°your offer, far from
surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in
the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;¡ªnay, I will
go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a
great favor at your hands.¡±

¡°Oh, pray name it.¡±

¡°I am wholly a stranger to Paris¡ªit is a city I have never yet seen.¡±

¡°Is it possible,¡± exclaimed Albert, ¡°that you have reached your present
age without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely
credit it.¡±

¡°Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking
that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to
me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all
probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty,
as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of
your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have
introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed
no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the
idea.¡±

¡°So distinguished an individual as yourself,¡± cried Albert, ¡°could
scarcely have required an introduction.¡±

¡°You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I
possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in
the speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in
travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of
dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should
present itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,
smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de
Morcerf¡± (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),
¡°whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the
doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or
a native of Cochin-China?¡±

¡°Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,¡± answered Albert; ¡°and so
much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father
summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear
Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and
connected with the very cream of Parisian society.¡±

¡°Connected by marriage, you mean,¡± said Franz, laughingly.

¡°Well, never mind how it is,¡± answered Albert, ¡°it comes to the same
thing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be
quite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative
I shall make of all the domestic virtues¡ªdon¡¯t you think so? But as
regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say
that you may command me and mine to any extent you please.¡±

¡°Then it is settled,¡± said the count, ¡°and I give you my solemn
assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize
plans that I have long meditated.¡±

Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the
count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while
the count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to read
something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was
inscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a
sphinx-like smile.

¡°But tell me now, count,¡± exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of
having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; ¡°tell me
truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris
is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we
make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built
on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?¡±

¡°I pledge you my honor,¡± returned the count, ¡°that I mean to do as I
have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit
Paris.¡±

¡°When do you propose going thither?¡±

¡°Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?¡±

¡°Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks¡¯ time, that is to say,
as fast as I can get there!¡±

¡°Nay,¡± said the Count; ¡°I will give you three months ere I join you; you
see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.

¡°And in three months¡¯ time,¡± said Albert, ¡°you will be at my house?¡±

¡°Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?¡±
inquired the count; ¡°only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my
punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.¡±

¡°Day for day, hour for hour,¡± said Albert; ¡°that will suit me to a dot.¡±

¡°So be it, then,¡± replied the count, and extending his hand towards a
calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, ¡°today is the 21st
of February;¡± and drawing out his watch, added, ¡°it is exactly half-past
ten o¡¯clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of
May at the same hour in the forenoon.¡±

¡°Capital!¡± exclaimed Albert; ¡°your breakfast shall be waiting.¡±

¡°Where do you live?¡±

¡°No. 27, Rue du Helder.¡±

¡°Have you bachelor¡¯s apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you
to any inconvenience.¡±

¡°I reside in my father¡¯s house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther
side of the courtyard, entirely separated from the main building.¡±

¡°Quite sufficient,¡± replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he
wrote down ¡°No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the
morning.¡±

¡°Now then,¡± said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, ¡°make
yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more
accurate in marking the time than myself.¡±

¡°Shall I see you again ere my departure?¡± asked Albert.

¡°That depends; when do you leave?¡±

¡°Tomorrow evening, at five o¡¯clock.¡±

¡°In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to
Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday
morning. And you, baron,¡± pursued the count, addressing Franz, ¡°do you
also depart tomorrow?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°For France?¡±

¡°No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.¡±

¡°Then we shall not meet in Paris?¡±

¡°I fear I shall not have that honor.¡±

¡°Well, since we must part,¡± said the count, holding out a hand to each
of the young men, ¡°allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant
journey.¡±

It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of
the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered at
its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.

20219m


¡°Let us understand each other,¡± said Albert; ¡°it is agreed¡ªis it
not?¡ªthat you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of
May, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for
your punctuality?¡±

¡°The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No.
27,¡± replied the count.

The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.

¡°What is the matter?¡± asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to
their own apartments; ¡°you seem more than commonly thoughtful.¡±

¡°I will confess to you, Albert,¡± replied Franz, ¡°the count is a very
singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris
fills me with a thousand apprehensions.¡±

¡°My dear fellow,¡± exclaimed Albert, ¡°what can there possibly be in that
to excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses.¡±

¡°Whether I am in my senses or not,¡± answered Franz, ¡°that is the way I
feel.¡±

¡°Listen to me, Franz,¡± said Albert; ¡°I am glad that the occasion has
presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you
are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has
always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular against
him?¡±

¡°Possibly.¡±

¡°Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?¡±

¡°I have.¡±

¡°And where?¡±

¡°Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to
tell you?¡±

¡°I promise.¡±

¡°Upon your honor?¡±

¡°Upon my honor.¡±

¡°Then listen to me.¡±

Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the
Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there,
and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with considerable force
and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the
count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the
Thousand and One Nights.

He recounted, with circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the
supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening,
there remained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small
yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward Porto-
Vecchio.

Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum,
between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain
the release of the bandit Peppino,¡ªan engagement which, as our readers
are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.

At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the
embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient
cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and
finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and
satisfactory result that followed. Albert listened with the most
profound attention.

¡°Well,¡± said he, when Franz had concluded, ¡°what do you find to object
to in all you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being
rich, possesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or
Southampton, and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts
belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense, and have the
same liking for this amusement. Now, by way of having a resting-place
during his excursions, avoiding the wretched cookery¡ªwhich has been
trying its best to poison me during the last four months, while you have
manfully resisted its effects for as many years,¡ªand obtaining a bed on
which it is possible to slumber, Monte Cristo has furnished for himself
a temporary abode where you first found him; but, to prevent the
possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted
palace, and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected
from so large an outlay of capital, he has wisely enough purchased the
island, and taken its name. Just ask yourself, my good fellow, whether
there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of
lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of?¡±

¡°But,¡± said Franz, ¡°the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his
vessel?¡±

¡°Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better
than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but
purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their
native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace
or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica,
my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect,
should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find
them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.¡±

¡°Still,¡± persisted Franz, ¡°I suppose you will allow that such men as
Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than
plunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence
the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?¡±

¡°My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that
influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source;
therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you
must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in
such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own
idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me
4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less
than 24,000 livres of our money¡ªa sum at which, most assuredly, I should
never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,¡± added
Albert with a laugh, ¡°that no prophet is honored in his own country.¡±

¡°Talking of countries,¡± replied Franz, ¡°of what country is the count,
what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune,
and what were those events of his early life¡ªa life as marvellous as
unknown¡ªthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy
a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your place, I
should like to have answered.¡±

¡°My dear Franz,¡± replied Albert, ¡°when, upon receipt of my letter, you
found the necessity of asking the count¡¯s assistance, you promptly went
to him, saying, ¡®My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to
deliver him.¡¯ Was not that nearly what you said?¡±

20222m


¡°It was.¡±

¡°Well, then, did he ask you, ¡®Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he
come by his name¡ªhis fortune? what are his means of existence? what is
his birthplace? of what country is he a native?¡¯ Tell me, did he put all
these questions to you?¡±

¡°I confess he asked me none.¡±

¡°No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where,
I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and
unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then, Franz,
when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks
me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or
Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris¡ªmerely to introduce him into
society¡ªwould you have me refuse? My good fellow, you must have lost
your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded
policy.¡±

And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of
affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments
were all on Albert¡¯s side.

¡°Well,¡± said Franz with a sigh, ¡°do as you please my dear viscount, for
your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of
all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular
personage.¡±

¡°He is a philanthropist,¡± answered the other; ¡°and no doubt his motive
in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you
are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced
the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can obtain
it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other. And
now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come, shall we take
our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter¡¯s?¡±

Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five
o¡¯clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and
Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.

But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his
expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed
in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count
of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de
Morcerf, he had written in pencil:

¡°27, Rue du Helder, on the 21st May, half-past ten A.M.¡±






Chapter 39. The Guests

In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of
Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st
of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a
pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite
another building, in which were the servants¡¯ apartments. Two windows
only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into
the court, and two at the back into the garden.

Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the
imperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the
Count and Countess of Morcerf.

A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at
intervals by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a
large gate of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A
small door, close to the lodge of the concierge, gave ingress and egress
to the servants and masters when they were on foot.

It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to
part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount¡¯s age
required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation
for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may
call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,
careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.
By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see
all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young
men, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if
that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then, should anything appear
to merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up
his researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the
concierge¡¯s door, and which merits a particular description.

It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the
house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was a
mockery to the concierge, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was
free, and, like that famous portal in the Arabian Nights, opening at the
¡°Sesame¡± of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word
or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest
fingers in the world.

At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and
which formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albert¡¯s breakfast-
room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into
the garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from
the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as
they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could
penetrate.

On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third,
formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a
boudoir, and a bedroom. The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan,
for the use of smokers. The boudoir upstairs communicated with the
bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident that
every precaution had been taken. Above this floor was a large atelier,
which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions¡ªa
pandemonium, in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence.

There were collected and piled up all Albert¡¯s successive caprices,
hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes¡ªa whole orchestra, for Albert had had
not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes,
pencils¡ªfor music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves,
broadswords, and single-sticks¡ªfor, following the example of the
fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with
far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that
complete a dandy¡¯s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick;
and it was here that he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.

The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della
Robbia fa?ences, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which
perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieu¡ªfor two of
these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the
Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.

Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed
beneath Persia¡¯s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta
or of Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to
say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to
their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their
golden and silky reflections.

In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet ¡°baby grand¡± piano
in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its
narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the
chefs-d¡¯?uvre of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Gr¨¦try, and Porpora.

On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers,
Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of
armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored
wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open. This
was Albert¡¯s favorite lounging place.

However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established
himself in the small salon downstairs. There, on a table, surrounded at
some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
known,¡ªfrom the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and
so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,¡ªwas
exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;
beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an
open cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their
amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their
long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the
smokers.

Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast
of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from
their mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.

At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom
named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert¡¯s establishment,
although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great
occasions the count¡¯s chasseur also. This valet, whose name was Germain,
and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held in one
hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters, which he
gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives,
selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed in
scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some
attention.

¡°How did these letters come?¡± said he.

¡°One by the post, Madame Danglars¡¯ footman left the other.¡±

¡°Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her
box. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera I
will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different
wine¡ªCyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get
them at Borel¡¯s, and be sure you say they are for me.¡±

¡°At what o¡¯clock, sir, do you breakfast?¡±

20227m


¡°What time is it now?¡±

¡°A quarter to ten.¡±

¡°Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to
the minister¡ªand besides¡± (Albert looked at his tablets), ¡°it is the
hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not
much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the countess up
yet?¡±

¡°If you wish, I will inquire.¡±

¡°Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and
tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o¡¯clock, and
that I request permission to introduce someone to her.¡±

The valet left the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the
cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre
announcements, made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet;
hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which
he had heard, and threw down, one after the other, the three leading
papers of Paris, muttering,

¡°These papers become more and more stupid every day.¡±

A moment after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant
announced M. Lucien Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear
gray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with
beautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell
eye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the
superciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a
half-official air, without smiling or speaking.

¡°Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,¡± said Albert; ¡°your punctuality
really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You, whom I expected last,
you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was half-past!
Has the ministry resigned?¡±

¡°No, my dear fellow,¡± returned the young man, seating himself on the
divan; ¡°reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,
and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,
and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us.¡±

¡°Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.¡±

¡°No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to the
other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at
Bourges.¡±

¡°At Bourges?¡±

¡°Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles
VII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day
before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do
not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon
as we do) made a million!¡±

¡°And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button-
hole.¡±

¡°Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,¡± returned Debray
carelessly.

¡°Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have
it.¡±

¡°Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat on a
black coat buttoned up.¡±

¡°And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt.¡±

¡°It is for that reason you see me so early.¡±

¡°Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce
the good news to me?¡±

¡°No, because I passed the night writing letters,¡ªfive-and-twenty
despatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my
head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de
Boulogne, ennui and hunger attacked me at once,¡ªtwo enemies who rarely
accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of
Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast this
morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.¡±

¡°It is my duty as your host,¡± returned Albert, ringing the bell, while
Lucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers that lay on
the table. ¡°Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In the meantime,
my dear Lucien, here are cigars¡ªcontraband, of course¡ªtry them, and
persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with
cabbage leaves.¡±

¡°Peste! I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from
government you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not concern
the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M. Humann,
section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.¡±

¡°On my word,¡± said Albert, ¡°you astonish me by the extent of your
knowledge. Take a cigar.¡±

¡°Really, my dear Albert,¡± replied Lucien, lighting a manilla at a rose-
colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand¡ª¡°how happy you
are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good fortune!¡±

¡°And what would you do, my dear diplomatist,¡± replied Morcerf, with a
slight degree of irony in his voice, ¡°if you did nothing? What? private
secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and
Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to protect,
parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your cabinet
with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battle-fields
with his sword and his victories; possessing five-and-twenty thousand
francs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which Chateau-Renaud
offered you four hundred louis, and which you would not part with; a
tailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the jockey-club, and
other diversions, can you not amuse yourself? Well, I will amuse you.¡±

¡°How?¡±

¡°By introducing to you a new acquaintance.¡±

¡°A man or a woman?¡±

¡°A man.¡±

¡°I know so many men already.¡±

¡°But you do not know this man.¡±

¡°Where does he come from¡ªthe end of the world?¡±

¡°Farther still, perhaps.¡±

¡°The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.¡±

¡°Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father¡¯s kitchen. Are you hungry?¡±

¡°Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de
Villefort¡¯s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would
think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?¡±

¡°Ah, depreciate other persons¡¯ dinners; you ministers give such splendid
ones.¡±

¡°Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced to
entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with
us, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.¡±

¡°Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.¡±

¡°Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite right
to pacify that country.¡±

¡°Yes; but Don Carlos?¡±

¡°Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry
his son to the little queen.¡±

¡°You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the
ministry.¡±

¡°I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
this morning.¡±

¡°Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I hear
Beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will pass
away the time.¡±

¡°About what?¡±

¡°About the papers.¡±

¡°My dear friend,¡± said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, ¡°do I
ever read the papers?¡±

¡°Then you will dispute the more.¡±

¡°M. Beauchamp,¡± announced the servant. ¡°Come in, come in,¡± said Albert,
rising and advancing to meet the young man. ¡°Here is Debray, who detests
you without reading you, so he says.¡±

¡°He is quite right,¡± returned Beauchamp; ¡°for I criticise him without
knowing what he does. Good-day, commander!¡±

¡°Ah, you know that already,¡± said the private secretary, smiling and
shaking hands with him.

¡°Pardieu!¡±

¡°And what do they say of it in the world?¡±

¡°In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.¡±

¡°In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.¡±

¡°They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought
to reap a little blue.¡±

¡°Come, come, that is not bad!¡± said Lucien. ¡°Why do you not join our
party, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make your fortune
in three or four years.¡±

¡°I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
minister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,
for I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must
go to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.¡±

¡°You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive we
shall sit down to table.¡±






Chapter 40. The Breakfast

And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?¡± said Beauchamp.

¡°A gentleman, and a diplomatist.¡±

¡°Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three for
the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some
strawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to the
Chamber.¡±

¡°Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,
and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the
meantime, follow Debray¡¯s example, and take a glass of sherry and a
biscuit.¡±

¡°Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.¡±

¡°You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is
out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.¡±

¡°Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this
morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and
at his wife¡¯s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France.
The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had our
choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?¡±

¡°I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.¡±

¡°Do not run down M. Danglars¡¯ speeches,¡± said Debray; ¡°he votes for you,
for he belongs to the opposition.¡±

¡°Pardieu, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you send
him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.¡±

¡°My dear friend,¡± said Albert to Beauchamp, ¡°it is plain that the
affairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor
this morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage
between myself and Mlle. Eug¨¦nie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,
therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say
to me, ¡®Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.¡¯¡±

¡°Ah, this marriage will never take place,¡± said Beauchamp. ¡°The king has
made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a
gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for
the paltry sum of two million francs, to a m¨¦salliance. The Viscount of
Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.¡±

¡°But two million francs make a nice little sum,¡± replied Morcerf.

¡°It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad
from the Jardin des Plantes to La Rap¨¦e.¡±

¡°Never mind what he says, Morcerf,¡± said Debray, ¡°do you marry her. You
marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter? It
is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have seven
martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have
four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly became King
of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.¡±

¡°On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,¡± said Albert absently.

¡°To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard¡ªthat
is, he can be.¡±

¡°Do not say that, Debray,¡± returned Beauchamp, laughing, ¡°for here is
Chateau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass
the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.¡±

¡°He will sully it then,¡± returned Lucien; ¡°for I am low¡ªvery low.¡±

¡°Oh, heavens,¡± cried Beauchamp, ¡°the minister quotes B¨¦ranger, what
shall we come to next?¡±

¡°M. de Chateau-Renaud¡ªM. Maximilian Morrel,¡± said the servant,
announcing two fresh guests.

¡°Now, then, to breakfast,¡± said Beauchamp; ¡°for, if I remember, you told
me you only expected two persons, Albert.¡±

¡°Morrel,¡± muttered Albert¡ª¡°Morrel¡ªwho is he?¡±

But before he had finished, M. de Chateau-Renaud, a handsome young man
of thirty, gentleman all over,¡ªthat is, with the figure of a Guiche and
the wit of a Mortemart,¡ªtook Albert¡¯s hand.

¡°My dear Albert,¡± said he, ¡°let me introduce to you M. Maximilian
Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is more¡ªhowever the man
speaks for himself¡ªmy preserver. Salute my hero, viscount.¡±

And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and
dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black
moustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under
circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten. A rich uniform,
half French, half Oriental, set off his graceful and stalwart figure,
and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor.
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness.

¡°Monsieur,¡± said Albert with affectionate courtesy, ¡°the count of
Chateau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me;
you are his friend, be ours also.¡±

¡°Well said,¡± interrupted Chateau-Renaud; ¡°and pray that, if you should
ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did
for me.¡±

¡°What has he done?¡± asked Albert.

¡°Oh, nothing worth speaking of,¡± said Morrel; ¡°M. de Chateau-Renaud
exaggerates.¡±

¡°Not worth speaking of?¡± cried Chateau-Renaud; ¡°life is not worth
speaking of!¡ªthat is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel. It is
very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who only
did so once¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life.¡±

¡°Exactly so.¡±

¡°On what occasion?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,¡± said Debray: ¡°do
not set him off on some long story.¡±

¡°Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,¡± replied Beauchamp,
¡°Chateau-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.¡±

¡°Gentlemen,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°it is only a quarter past ten, and I expect
someone else.¡±

¡°Ah, true, a diplomatist!¡± observed Debray.

¡°Diplomat or not, I don¡¯t know; I only know that he charged himself on
my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my
satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him
knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden
Fleece and the Garter.¡±

¡°Well, since we are not to sit down to table,¡± said Debray, ¡°take a
glass of sherry, and tell us all about it.¡±

¡°You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.¡±

¡°It is a road your ancestors have traced for you,¡± said Albert
gallantly.

¡°Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs¡ªto rescue the Holy
Sepulchre.¡±

¡°You are quite right, Beauchamp,¡± observed the young aristocrat. ¡°It was
only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear duelling ever since two
seconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the
arm of one of my best friends, one whom you all know¡ªpoor Franz
d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

¡°Ah, true,¡± said Debray, ¡°you did fight some time ago; about what?¡±

20235m


¡°The devil take me, if I remember,¡± returned Chateau-Renaud. ¡°But I
recollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let such talents
as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols that had
been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went from
thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the
raising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight-and-forty
hours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the night
tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor
brute¡ªaccustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable, the
Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia.¡±

¡°That¡¯s why you want to purchase my English horse,¡± said Debray, ¡°you
think he will bear the cold better.¡±

¡°You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.¡±

¡°You were very much frightened, then?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,¡± replied Chateau-Renaud. ¡°I
was retreating on foot, for my horse was dead. Six Arabs came up, full
gallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my double-barrelled gun, and
two more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were still
left; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so short, for
no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan, and I already
felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom you see here
charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and cleft the skull
of the other with his sabre. He had assigned himself the task of saving
a man¡¯s life that day; chance caused that man to be myself. When I am
rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Morrel, smiling, ¡°it was the 5th of September, the
anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved;
therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by
some¡ª¡ª¡±

20237m


¡°Heroic action,¡± interrupted Chateau-Renaud. ¡°I was chosen. But that is
not all¡ªafter rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,
not by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the
whole; then from hunger by sharing with me¡ªguess what?¡±

¡°A Strasbourg pie?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
appetite. It was very hard.¡±

¡°The horse?¡± said Morcerf, laughing.

¡°No, the sacrifice,¡± returned Chateau-Renaud; ¡°ask Debray if he would
sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?¡±

¡°Not for a stranger,¡± said Debray, ¡°but for a friend I might, perhaps.¡±

¡°I divined that you would become mine, count,¡± replied Morrel; ¡°besides,
as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that
day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good
fortune had on other days granted to us.¡±

¡°The history to which M. Morrel alludes,¡± continued Chateau-Renaud, ¡°is
an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better
acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our
memories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?¡±

¡°At half-past ten.¡±

¡°Precisely?¡± asked Debray, taking out his watch.

¡°Oh, you will give me five minutes¡¯ grace,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°for I also
expect a preserver.¡±

¡°Of whom?¡±

¡°Of myself,¡± cried Morcerf; ¡°parbleu! do you think I cannot be saved as
well as anyone else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads?
Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table¡ªat
least, I hope so¡ªtwo benefactors of humanity.¡±

¡°What shall we do?¡± said Debray; ¡°we have only one Monthyon prize.¡±

¡°Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,¡±
said Beauchamp; ¡°that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the
dilemma.¡±

¡°And where does he come from?¡± asked Debray. ¡°You have already answered
the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second
time.¡±

¡°Really,¡± said Albert, ¡°I do not know; when I invited him three months
ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may
have gone?¡±

¡°And you think him capable of being exact?¡± demanded Debray.

¡°I think him capable of everything.¡±

¡°Well, with the five minutes¡¯ grace, we have only ten left.¡±

¡°I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.¡±

¡°I beg pardon,¡± interrupted Beauchamp; ¡°are there any materials for an
article in what you are going to tell us?¡±

¡°Yes, and for a most curious one.¡±

¡°Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and
I must make up for it.¡±

¡°I was at Rome during the last Carnival.¡±

¡°We know that,¡± said Beauchamp.

¡°Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.¡±

¡°There are no bandits,¡± cried Debray.

¡°Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I
found them ugly enough to frighten me.¡±

¡°Come, my dear Albert,¡± said Debray, ¡°confess that your cook is
behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes,
and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish by
a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you,
and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.¡±

¡°And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one from
beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a
gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.¡±

¡°I know it,¡± said Chateau-Renaud; ¡°I narrowly escaped catching a fever
there.¡±

¡°And I did more than that,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°for I caught one. I was
informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman
crowns¡ªabout 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. I was
at the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to Franz¡ªand were he
here he would confirm every word¡ªI wrote then to Franz that if he did
not come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past I
should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in
whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such was
the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously kept his
word.¡±

¡°But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,¡± said Chateau-Renaud.
¡°A man whose name is Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much
difficulty in procuring them.¡±

¡°No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to
you.¡±

¡°Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing
Andromeda.¡±

¡°No, he is a man about my own size.¡±

¡°Armed to the teeth?¡±

¡°He had not even a knitting-needle.¡±

¡°But he paid your ransom?¡±

¡°He said two words to the chief and I was free.¡±

¡°And they apologized to him for having carried you off?¡± said Beauchamp.

¡°Just so.¡±

¡°Why, he is a second Ariosto.¡±

¡°No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°There is no Count of Monte Cristo¡± said Debray.

¡°I do not think so,¡± added Chateau-Renaud, with the air of a man who
knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.

¡°Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors
possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.¡±

¡°I think I can assist your researches,¡± said Maximilian. ¡°Monte Cristo
is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my
father employed¡ªa grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an
atom in the infinite.¡±

¡°Precisely!¡± cried Albert. ¡°Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and
master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title
of count somewhere in Tuscany.¡±

¡°He is rich, then?¡±

¡°I believe so.¡±

¡°But that ought to be visible.¡±

¡°That is what deceives you, Debray.¡±

¡°I do not understand you.¡±

¡°Have you read the Arabian Nights?¡±

¡°What a question!¡±

¡°Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor
fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the
wealth of the Indies.¡±

¡°Which means?¡±

¡°Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. He
has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad the
Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.¡±

¡°And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°No, but Franz has; for heaven¡¯s sake, not a word of this before him.
Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and
by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is not quite
sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken
hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of
statues.¡±

The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,¡ª¡°Are you mad, or are
you laughing at us?¡±

¡°And I also,¡± said Morrel thoughtfully, ¡°have heard something like this
from an old sailor named Penelon.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± cried Albert, ¡°it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me;
you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?¡±

¡°My dear Albert,¡± said Debray, ¡°what you tell us is so extraordinary.¡±

¡°Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of
them¡ªthey have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering in
the affairs of their countrymen who travel.¡±

¡°Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have them
protect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that now
they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send you
to Constantinople.¡±

¡°No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali, the
Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.¡±

¡°You say very true,¡± responded Debray.

¡°Yes,¡± said Albert, ¡°but this has nothing to do with the existence of
the Count of Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°Pardieu! everyone exists.¡±

¡°Doubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a
princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek
mistresses.¡±

¡°Have you seen the Greek mistress?¡±

¡°I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard her
one morning when I breakfasted with the count.¡±

¡°He eats, then?¡±

¡°Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.¡±

¡°He must be a vampire.¡±

¡°Laugh, if you will; the Countess G¡ª¡ª, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared
that the count was a vampire.¡±

¡°Ah, capital,¡± said Beauchamp. ¡°For a man not connected with newspapers,
here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the Constitutionnel.¡±

¡°Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,¡± said
Debray; ¡°facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid
complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness
unexceptionable.¡±

¡°Just so, Lucien,¡± returned Morcerf; ¡°you have described him feature for
feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has often made me
shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I thought I
should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he
spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the
executioner and the culprit.¡±

¡°Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your
blood?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?¡±

¡°Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,¡± said Morcerf, somewhat
piqued. ¡°When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand
or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are
not of the same race.¡±

¡°I am highly flattered,¡± returned Beauchamp.

¡°At the same time,¡± added Chateau-Renaud, ¡°your Count of Monte Cristo is
a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with the
Italian banditti.¡±

¡°There are no Italian banditti,¡± said Debray.

¡°No vampire,¡± cried Beauchamp.

¡°No Count of Monte Cristo¡± added Debray. ¡°There is half-past ten
striking, Albert.¡±

20243m


¡°Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,¡±
continued Beauchamp.

But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced,
¡°His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.¡± The involuntary start
everyone gave proved how much Morcerf¡¯s narrative had impressed them,
and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden
emotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the street, or steps in the
antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly. The count appeared,
dressed with the greatest simplicity, but the most fastidious dandy
could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet. Every article of
dress¡ªhat, coat, gloves, and boots¡ªwas from the first makers. He seemed
scarcely five-and-thirty. But what struck everybody was his extreme
resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn. The count advanced,
smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached Albert, who
hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner.

¡°Punctuality,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°is the politeness of kings, according
to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it is not the same with
travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I
am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without
some trouble, and especially in France, where, it seems, it is forbidden
to beat the postilions.¡±

¡°My dear count,¡± replied Albert, ¡°I was announcing your visit to some of
my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me
the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They are the Count of
Chateau-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose
ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray, private
secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an editor of a
paper, and the terror of the French government, but of whom, in spite of
his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in Italy, since his
paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis.¡±

At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy,
but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace
forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.

¡°You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,¡± said he;
¡°it is a handsome uniform.¡±

No one could have said what caused the count¡¯s voice to vibrate so
deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear,
lustrous, and limpid when he pleased.

¡°You have never seen our Africans, count?¡± said Albert.

¡°Never,¡± replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of
himself again.

¡°Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts
in the whole army.¡±

¡°Oh, M. de Morcerf,¡± interrupted Morrel.

¡°Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard,¡± continued Albert, ¡°of a
new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I have seen him
today for the first time, I request you to allow me to introduce him as
my friend.¡±

At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the
concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid
that show emotion.

¡°Ah, you have a noble heart,¡± said the count; ¡°so much the better.¡±

This exclamation, which corresponded to the count¡¯s own thought rather
than to what Albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially
Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder. But, at the same time,
the intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem,
it was impossible to be offended at it.

20245m


¡°Why should he doubt it?¡± said Beauchamp to Chateau-Renaud.

¡°In reality,¡± replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and
his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
penetrable in Monte Cristo, ¡°Albert has not deceived us, for the count
is a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!¡±

¡°Ma foi, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of the
singular remark he has made about me.¡±

¡°Gentlemen,¡± said Albert, ¡°Germain informs me that breakfast is ready.
My dear count, allow me to show you the way.¡± They passed silently into
the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.

¡°Gentlemen,¡± said the count, seating himself, ¡°permit me to make a
confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may commit.
I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is the first
time I have ever been at Paris. The French way of living is utterly
unknown to me, and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern
customs, which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian. I beg you,
therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too
Italian, or too Arabian. Now, then, let us breakfast.¡±

¡°With what an air he says all this,¡± muttered Beauchamp; ¡°decidedly he
is a great man.¡±

¡°A great man in his own country,¡± added Debray.

¡°A great man in every country, M. Debray,¡± said Chateau-Renaud.

The count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert
remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian
mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point.

¡°My dear count,¡± said he, ¡°I fear one thing, and that is, that the fare
of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza
di Spagna. I ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had some
dishes prepared expressly.¡±

¡°Did you know me better,¡± returned the count, smiling, ¡°you would not
give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who has
successively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla podrida
at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and swallows¡¯
nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only I eat but
little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of appetite, is my
day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday morning.¡±

¡°What,¡± cried all the guests, ¡°you have not eaten for four-and-twenty
hours?¡±

¡°No,¡± replied the count; ¡°I was forced to go out of my road to obtain
some information near N?mes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore
I did not choose to stop.¡±

¡°And you ate in your carriage?¡± asked Morcerf.

¡°No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the
courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to
eat.¡±

¡°But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?¡± said Morrel.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You have a recipe for it?¡±

¡°An infallible one.¡±

¡°That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food
to eat, and rarely anything to drink.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a
man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might
not awake when it was needed.¡±

¡°May we inquire what is this recipe?¡± asked Debray.

¡°Oh, yes,¡± returned Monte Cristo; ¡°I make no secret of it. It is a
mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order
to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East¡ªthat is,
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed in
equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is
taken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay; I think he
tasted them one day.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°he said something about it to me.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
incredulous, ¡°you always carry this drug about you?¡±

¡°Always.¡±

¡°Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?¡±
continued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.

¡°No, monsieur,¡± returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a
marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden
lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet
about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor.
There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain about a
dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to examine
the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to
hand.

¡°And is it your cook who prepares these pills?¡± asked Beauchamp.

¡°Oh, no, monsieur,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°I do not thus betray my
enjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my pills
myself.¡±

¡°This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,¡± said
Chateau-Renaud, ¡°although my mother has some remarkable family jewels.¡±

¡°I had three similar ones,¡± returned Monte Cristo. ¡°I gave one to the
Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the
Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large,
though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor,
Pius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which
reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I
intended.¡±

Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so much
simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was mad.
However, the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the
former belief.

¡°And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these
magnificent presents?¡± asked Debray.

¡°The Sultan, the liberty of a woman,¡± replied the Count; ¡°the Pope, the
life of a man; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if
heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne.¡±

¡°And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?¡± cried Morcerf; ¡°it was for
him that you obtained pardon?¡±

¡°Perhaps,¡± returned the count, smiling.

¡°My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you
speak thus,¡± said Morcerf. ¡°I had announced you beforehand to my friends
as an enchanter of the Arabian Nights, a wizard of the Middle Ages; but
the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices
of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when these truths do
not form a part of their daily existence. For example, here is Debray
who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, ¡®A member of the Jockey
Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard;¡¯ ¡®four persons have
been assassinated in the Rue St. Denis¡¯ or ¡®the Faubourg St. Germain;¡¯
¡®ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a caf¨¦ on the
Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,¡¯¡ªand yet these same
men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the Campagna di
Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them yourself that I was taken by
bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should now have
been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of receiving
them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°you promised me never to mention that
circumstance.¡±

¡°It was not I who made that promise,¡± cried Morcerf; ¡°it must have been
someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you have
forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust, relate the
little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.¡±

¡°It seems to me,¡± returned the count, smiling, ¡°that you played a
sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.¡±

20249m


¡°Well, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your turn,
all that I do not know?¡±

¡°That is but fair,¡± replied Monte Cristo.

¡°Well,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°for three days I believed myself the object of
the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or
Popp?a, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina,
and I say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl. What I know is, that,
like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I mistook
for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a
beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint a
chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by
seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of
St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing
C?sar¡¯s Commentaries, and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me,
that unless the next morning, before six o¡¯clock, four thousand piastres
were paid into his account at his banker¡¯s, at a quarter past six I
should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen, for it is
in Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay¡¯s possession, signed by me, and with a postscript of
M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I know, but I know not, count, how you
contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who
ordinarily have so little respect for anything. I assure you, Franz and
I were lost in admiration.¡±

¡°Nothing more simple,¡± returned the count. ¡°I had known the famous Vampa
for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and only a shepherd,
I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he, in order to
repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had carved with his
own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of arms. In after
years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents, which
ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he did not recollect
me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it was I who captured
him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him over to Roman
justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been
particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort¡ªI suffered him
and his band to depart.¡±

¡°With the condition that they should sin no more,¡± said Beauchamp,
laughing. ¡°I see they kept their promise.¡±

¡°No, monsieur,¡± returned Monte Cristo ¡°upon the simple condition that
they should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to
say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and
your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which
does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies
itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place
in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society
and my neighbor who are indebted to me.¡±

¡°Bravo,¡± cried Chateau-Renaud; ¡°you are the first man I ever met
sufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!¡±

¡°It is frank, at least,¡± said Morrel. ¡°But I am sure that the count does
not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly
avowed.¡±

¡°How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?¡± asked Monte
Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,
that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
clear and piercing glance.

¡°Why, it seems to me,¡± replied Morrel, ¡°that in delivering M. de
Morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to
society.¡±

¡°Of which he is the brightest ornament,¡± said Beauchamp, drinking off a
glass of champagne.

¡°My dear count,¡± cried Morcerf, ¡°you are at fault¡ªyou, one of the most
formidable logicians I know¡ªand you must see it clearly proved that
instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call
yourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family
name is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,
and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display
the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric
Parisians,¡ªthat is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the
virtues you possess.¡±

¡°My dear vicomte,¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°I do not see, in all I have
done, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the
pretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for I
knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to
breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival
in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo
the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted. I will
appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of
a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had the idea
that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to
France. You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a
vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and you must submit
to it under penalty of breaking your word.¡±

¡°I will keep it,¡± returned Morcerf; ¡°but I fear that you will be much
disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic
horizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with
which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our Chimborazo
is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Val¨¦rien, our Great Desert is the
plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water
the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said;
but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord.
France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not
find in its eighty-five departments¡ªI say eighty-five, because I do not
include Corsica¡ªyou will not find, then, in these eighty-five
departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto
in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp. There is but
one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely at
your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you
everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you¡ªwith
your name, and your fortune, and your talent¡± (Monte Cristo bowed with a
somewhat ironical smile) ¡°you can present yourself everywhere, and be
well received. I can be useful in one way only¡ªif knowledge of Parisian
habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the
bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting
dwelling here. I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I
shared yours at Rome¡ªI, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist
par excellence; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow
more, unless that shadow were feminine.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the count, ¡°that is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect
that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage. May I
congratulate you?¡±

¡°The affair is still in projection.¡±

¡°And he who says in ¡®projection,¡¯ means already decided,¡± said Debray.

¡°No,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°my father is most anxious about it; and I hope,
ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my
betrothed¡ªMademoiselle Eug¨¦nie Danglars.¡±

¡°Eug¨¦nie Danglars,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°tell me, is not her father Baron
Danglars?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± returned Morcerf, ¡°a baron of a new creation.¡±

¡°What matter,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°if he has rendered the State services
which merit this distinction?¡±

¡°Enormous ones,¡± answered Beauchamp. ¡°Although in reality a Liberal, he
negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made him
a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the
ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his
button-hole.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± interrupted Morcerf, laughing, ¡°Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that
for the Corsaire or the Charivari, but spare my future father-in-law
before me.¡± Then, turning to Monte Cristo, ¡°You just now spoke his name
as if you knew the baron?¡±

¡°I do not know him,¡± returned Monte Cristo; ¡°but I shall probably soon
make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house
of Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson
& French at Rome.¡± As he pronounced the two last names, the count
glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger expected to produce an
effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken¡ªMaximilian started as if he had
been electrified.

¡°Thomson & French,¡± said he; ¡°do you know this house, monsieur?¡±

¡°They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,¡± returned
the count quietly. ¡°Can my influence with them be of any service to
you?¡±

¡°Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,
up to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a
great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having
rendered us this service.¡±

¡°I shall be at your orders,¡± said Monte Cristo bowing.

¡°But,¡± continued Morcerf, ¡°¨¤ propos of Danglars,¡ªwe have strangely
wandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable habitation for
the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some
place. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?¡±

¡°Faubourg Saint-Germain,¡± said Chateau-Renaud. ¡°The count will find
there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.¡±

¡°Bah! Chateau-Renaud,¡± returned Debray, ¡°you only know your dull and
gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him,
count¡ªlive in the Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin, that¡¯s the real centre of Paris.¡±

¡°Boulevard de l¡¯Op¨¦ra,¡± said Beauchamp; ¡°the second floor¡ªa house with a
balcony. The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there,
and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.¡±

¡°You have no idea, then, Morrel?¡± asked Chateau-Renaud; ¡°you do not
propose anything.¡±

¡°Oh, yes,¡± returned the young man, smiling; ¡°on the contrary, I have
one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant
proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will
venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the
Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue
Meslay.¡±

¡°You have a sister?¡± asked the count.

¡°Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.¡±

¡°Married?¡±

¡°Nearly nine years.¡±

¡°Happy?¡± asked the count again.

¡°As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,¡± replied
Maximilian. ¡°She married the man she loved, who remained faithful to us
in our fallen fortunes¡ªEmmanuel Herbaut.¡±

Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly.

¡°I live there during my leave of absence,¡± continued Maximilian; ¡°and I
shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition
of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.¡±

¡°One minute,¡± cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to
reply. ¡°Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the
Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch
of him.¡±

20255m


¡°Oh, no,¡± said Morrel; ¡°my sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law
is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the count will be in
his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.¡±

¡°Thanks, monsieur,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°I shall content myself with
being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the
honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these
gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.¡±

¡°What,¡± cried Morcerf; ¡°you are, then, going to a hotel¡ªthat will be
very dull for you.¡±

¡°Was I so badly lodged at Rome?¡± said Monte Cristo smiling.

¡°Parbleu! at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your
apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar
sum every day.¡±

¡°It is not that which deterred me,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°but as I
determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre, and
he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.¡±

¡°But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?¡± said
Beauchamp.

¡°It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and cannot
speak,¡± returned Monte Cristo.

¡°It is Ali!¡± cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.

¡°Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.¡±

¡°Certainly,¡± said Morcerf; ¡°I recollect him perfectly. But how could you
charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?¡ªhe will
do everything wrong.¡±

¡°Undeceive yourself, monsieur,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°I am quite sure,
that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows my
tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the
instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for
me. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o¡¯clock; he was waiting
for me at nine at the Barri¨¨re de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper;
it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,¡± and Monte
Cristo passed a paper to Albert.

¡°Ah, that is really original,¡± said Beauchamp.

¡°And very princely,¡± added Chateau-Renaud.

¡°What, do you not know your house?¡± asked Debray.

¡°No,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°I told you I did not wish to be behind my
time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount¡¯s
door.¡± The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a
comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an
air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was
false¡ªbesides, why should he tell a falsehood?

¡°We must content ourselves, then,¡± said Beauchamp, ¡°with rendering the
count all the little services in our power. I, in my quality of
journalist, open all the theatres to him.¡±

¡°Thanks, monsieur,¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°my steward has orders to
take a box at each theatre.¡±

¡°Is your steward also a Nubian?¡± asked Debray.

¡°No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of
anyone¡¯s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.¡±

¡°Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so
well?¡±

¡°Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been
a soldier, a smuggler¡ªin fact, everything. I would not be quite sure
that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle¡ªa stab
with a knife, for instance.¡±

¡°And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,¡± said Debray.
¡°Of how much does he rob you every year?¡±

¡°On my word,¡± replied the count, ¡°not more than another. I am sure he
answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.¡±

¡°Then,¡± continued Chateau-Renaud, ¡°since you have an establishment, a
steward, and a hotel in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, you only want a mistress.¡±
Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count¡¯s
box at the Argentina and Valle theatres.

¡°I have something better than that,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°I have a slave.
You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the
Vari¨¦t¨¦s; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I
have nothing to fear.¡±

¡°But you forget,¡± replied Debray, laughing, ¡°that we are Franks by name
and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts
her foot in France your slave becomes free.¡±

¡°Who will tell her?¡±

¡°The first person who sees her.¡±

¡°She only speaks Romaic.¡±

¡°That is different.¡±

¡°But at least we shall see her,¡± said Beauchamp, ¡°or do you keep eunuchs
as well as mutes?¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°I do not carry brutalism so far.
Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me
will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that
reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.¡±

They had long since passed to dessert and cigars.

¡°My dear Albert,¡± said Debray, rising, ¡°it is half-past two. Your guest
is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst
sometimes. I must return to the minister¡¯s. I will tell him of the
count, and we shall soon know who he is.¡±

¡°Take care,¡± returned Albert; ¡°no one has been able to accomplish that.¡±

¡°Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost
always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
thousand francs to spend for this purpose.¡±

¡°And when you know, will you tell me?¡±

¡°I promise you. Au revoir, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.¡±

As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, ¡°My carriage.¡±

¡°Bravo,¡± said Beauchamp to Albert; ¡°I shall not go to the Chamber, but I
have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M. Danglars.¡±

¡°For heaven¡¯s sake, Beauchamp,¡± returned Morcerf, ¡°do not deprive me of
the merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he not peculiar?¡±

¡°He is more than that,¡± replied Chateau-Renaud; ¡°he is one of the most
extraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?¡±

¡°Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us
a visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.¡±

¡°Be sure I shall not fail to do so,¡± returned the count, bowing.

And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Chateau-Renaud,
leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.






Chapter 41. The Presentation

When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, ¡°My dear count,¡± said
he, ¡°allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a
specimen of a bachelor¡¯s apartment. You, who are accustomed to the
palaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square
feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As we
pass from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you
breathe.¡±

Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon on the
ground floor. Albert led him first to his atelier, which was, as we have
said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that
Albert had collected here¡ªold cabinets, Japanese porcelain, Oriental
stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the world¡ªeverything was
familiar to him; and at the first glance he recognized their date, their
country, and their origin.

Morcerf had expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he
who, under the count¡¯s guidance, followed a course of arch?ology,
mineralogy, and natural history.

They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon.
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were
landscapes by Dupr¨¦, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing
oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix¡¯s Arabian cavaliers, with their
long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their
horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders
contended fiercely with their maces; aquarelles of Boulanger,
representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist
the rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his
flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the
sun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa,
but more poetic; pastels by Giraud and M¨¹ller, representing children
like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from
the album of Dauzats¡¯ ¡°Travels in the East,¡± that had been made in a few
seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque¡ªin a
word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the
art lost and gone with ages long since past.

Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the
traveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for
the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named
instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy
to see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style
associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him. From the
salon they passed into the bedchamber; it was a model of taste and
simple elegance. A single portrait, signed by L¨¦opold Robert, shone in
its carved and gilded frame. This portrait attracted the Count of Monte
Cristo¡¯s attention, for he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and
stopped suddenly before it.

It was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, with a
dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long
lashes. She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a
red and black bodice, and golden pins in her hair. She was looking at
the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky. The light
was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that
spread itself over the count¡¯s visage, or the nervous heaving of his
chest and shoulders. Silence prevailed for an instant, during which
Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.

¡°You have there a most charming mistress, viscount,¡± said the count in a
perfectly calm tone; ¡°and this costume¡ªa ball costume, doubtless¡ªbecomes
her admirably.¡±

¡°Ah, monsieur,¡± returned Albert, ¡°I would never forgive you this mistake
if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my mother;
she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus six or
eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the
resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as
she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the
count¡¯s absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable
surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my
father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the
best works of L¨¦opold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It
is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most
assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a
most mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who paints
exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a picture,
gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to displease M.
de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my
talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing
you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to
this picture. The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my
mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely
does she look at it without weeping. This disagreement is the only one
that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still
as much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first
day of their wedding.¡±

20261m


Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning
in his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the
simplicity of his heart.

¡°Now,¡± said Albert, ¡°that you have seen all my treasures, allow me to
offer them to you, unworthy as they are. Consider yourself as in your
own house, and to put yourself still more at your ease, pray accompany
me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I wrote from Rome an
account of the services you rendered me, and to whom I announced your
promised visit, and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously
desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat blas¨¦ I know, and family
scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor, who has seen so many
others. However, accept what I propose to you as an initiation into
Parisian life¡ªa life of politeness, visiting, and introductions.¡±

Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he accepted the offer
without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of those conventions of
society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty. Albert summoned his
servant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame de Morcerf of the
arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed him with the
count. When they arrived at the antechamber, above the door was visible
a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of
the furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached to this
blazon. Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively.

¡°Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender,¡± said he. ¡°These are,
doubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that
enables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry¡ªI, a count
of a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery of
St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been
told that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must have
something on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by
the custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you.¡±

¡°It is not indiscreet,¡± returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of
conviction. ¡°You have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that is,
those of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield,
which has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother¡¯s. By her side I am
Spanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have heard, one of
the oldest of the south of France.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied Monte Cristo ¡°these blazons prove that. Almost all the
armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a
cross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of the
long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to
accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the
Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you
mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.¡±

¡°It is possible,¡± said Morcerf; ¡°my father has in his study a
genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made
commentaries that would have greatly edified d¡¯Hozier and Jaucourt. At
present I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are
beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our
popular government.¡±

¡°Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past
something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,
and which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,¡±
continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, ¡°you are more fortunate than the
government, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the
imagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that
explains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much
admired on the visage of the noble Catalan.¡±

It would have required the penetration of ?dipus or the Sphinx to have
divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words, apparently
uttered with the greatest politeness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile,
and pushed open the door above which were his arms, and which, as we
have said, opened into the salon. In the most conspicuous part of the
salon was another portrait. It was that of a man, from five to eight-
and-thirty, in the uniform of a general officer, wearing the double
epaulet of heavy bullion, that indicates superior rank, the ribbon of
the Legion of Honor around his neck, which showed he was a commander,
and on the right breast, the star of a grand officer of the order of the
Saviour, and on the left that of the grand cross of Charles III., which
proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars
of Greece and Spain, or, what was just the same thing as regarded
decorations, had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries.

Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care
than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he
found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person.

He was a man of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty,
and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his
almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He was
dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the
different orders to which he belonged.

He entered with a tolerably dignified step, and some little haste. Monte
Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step. It
seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground, and his eyes on the
Count of Morcerf.

¡°Father,¡± said the young man, ¡°I have the honor of presenting to you the
Count of Monte Cristo, the generous friend whom I had the good fortune
to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you.¡±

¡°You are most welcome, monsieur,¡± said the Count of Morcerf, saluting
Monte Cristo with a smile, ¡°and monsieur has rendered our house, in
preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal
gratitude.¡±

As he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair, while
he seated himself in another opposite the window.

Monte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in
such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet
curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a
whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted
there.

¡°The countess,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°was at her toilet when she was informed
of the visit she was about to receive. She will, however, be in the
salon in ten minutes.¡±

¡°It is a great honor to me,¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°to be thus, on the
first day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose
merit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been
equitable, but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja, or in the
mountains of Atlas, a marshal¡¯s staff to offer you?¡±

¡°Oh,¡± replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, ¡°I have left the service,
monsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through the first
campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could, therefore,
expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the
elder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July was, it
seems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it
was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I
tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the
battle-field, you do not know how to man?uvre on the slippery grounds of
the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics. I
have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the
twenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the time.¡±

¡°These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,¡±
returned Monte Cristo. ¡°A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an ample
fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure
soldier, step by step¡ªthis is uncommon; then become general, peer of
France, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence
a second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than
that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed,
is praiseworthy,¡ªnay, more, it is sublime.¡±

20265m


Albert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see
Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm.

¡°Alas,¡± continued the stranger, doubtless to dispel the slight cloud
that covered Morcerf¡¯s brow, ¡°we do not act thus in Italy; we grow
according to our race and our species, and we pursue the same lines, and
often the same uselessness, all our lives.¡±

¡°But, monsieur,¡± said the Count of Morcerf, ¡°for a man of your merit,
Italy is not a country, and France opens her arms to receive you;
respond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful. She
treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.¡±

¡°Ah, father,¡± said Albert with a smile, ¡°it is evident you do not know
the Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself
with those written on his passport.¡±

¡°That is the most just remark,¡± replied the stranger, ¡°I ever heard made
concerning myself.¡±

¡°You have been free to choose your career,¡± observed the Count of
Morcerf, with a sigh; ¡°and you have chosen the path strewed with
flowers.¡±

¡°Precisely, monsieur,¡± replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles
that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.

¡°If I did not fear to fatigue you,¡± said the general, evidently charmed
with the count¡¯s manners, ¡°I would have taken you to the Chamber; there
is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern
senators.¡±

¡°I shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time,
renew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being
introduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait.¡±

¡°Ah, here is my mother,¡± cried the viscount.

Monte Cristo, turned round hastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the
entrance of the salon, at the door opposite to that by which her husband
had entered, pale and motionless; when Monte Cristo turned round, she
let fall her arm, which for some unknown reason had been resting on the
gilded door-post. She had been there some moments, and had heard the
last words of the visitor. The latter rose and bowed to the countess,
who inclined herself without speaking.

¡°Ah! good heavens, madame,¡± said the count, ¡°are you ill, or is it the
heat of the room that affects you?¡±

¡°Are you ill, mother?¡± cried the viscount, springing towards her.

She thanked them both with a smile.

¡°No,¡± returned she, ¡°but I feel some emotion on seeing, for the first
time, the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears
and desolation. Monsieur,¡± continued the countess, advancing with the
majesty of a queen, ¡°I owe to you the life of my son, and for this I
bless you. Now, I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus
affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you, from
the bottom of my heart.¡±

The count bowed again, but lower than before; he was even paler than
Merc¨¦d¨¨s.

¡°Madame,¡± said he, ¡°the count and yourself recompense too generously a
simple action. To save a man, to spare a father¡¯s feelings, or a
mother¡¯s sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed of
humanity.¡±

At these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and
politeness, Madame de Morcerf replied:

¡°It is very fortunate for my son, monsieur, that he found such a friend,
and I thank God that things are thus.¡±

And Merc¨¦d¨¨s raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an
expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them. M.
de Morcerf approached her.

¡°Madame,¡± said he. ¡°I have already made my excuses to the count for
quitting him, and I pray you to do so also. The sitting commences at
two; it is now three, and I am to speak.¡±

¡°Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your
absence,¡± replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.
¡°Monsieur,¡± continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, ¡°will you do us the
honor of passing the rest of the day with us?¡±

¡°Believe me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I got
out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am
ignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is but
a trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated.¡±

¡°We shall have the pleasure another time,¡± said the countess; ¡°you
promise that?¡±

Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but the gesture might
pass for assent.

¡°I will not detain you, monsieur,¡± continued the countess; ¡°I would not
have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.¡±

¡°My dear Count,¡± said Albert, ¡°I will endeavor to return your politeness
at Rome, and place my coup¨¦ at your disposal until your own be ready.¡±

¡°A thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,¡± returned the Count of
Monte Cristo ¡°but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably employed the
four hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find a carriage
of some sort ready at the door.¡±

Albert was used to the count¡¯s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like
Nero, he was in search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him,
but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count¡¯s orders had
been executed, he accompanied him to the door of the house. Monte Cristo
was not deceived. As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerf¡¯s
antechamber, a footman, the same who at Rome had brought the count¡¯s
card to the two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into the
vestibule, and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller
found his carriage awaiting him. It was a coup¨¦ of Koller¡¯s building,
and with horses and harness for which Drake had, to the knowledge of all
the lions of Paris, refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas.

¡°Monsieur,¡± said the count to Albert, ¡°I do not ask you to accompany me
to my house, as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry,
and I have, as you know, a reputation to keep up as regards not being
taken by surprise. Give me, therefore, one more day before I invite you;
I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.¡±

¡°If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not
be a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius at
your control.¡±

¡°Ma foi, spread that idea,¡± replied the Count of Monte Cristo, putting
his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage, ¡°and that
will be worth something to me among the ladies.¡±

As he spoke, he sprang into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not so
rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible
movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had
left Madame de Morcerf.

When Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir
reclining in a large velvet armchair, the whole room so obscure that
only the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and
the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some degree
of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the
countess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head,
and which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him as
though her voice had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes of
the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant
odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the
mantle-piece the countess¡¯s smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen
case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered:

¡°My dear mother, have you been ill during my absence?¡±

¡°No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers
throw out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes.¡±

¡°Then, my dear mother,¡± said Albert, putting his hand to the bell, ¡°they
must be taken into the antechamber. You are really ill, and just now
were so pale as you came into the room¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Was I pale, Albert?¡±

¡°Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the
less alarm my father and myself.¡±

¡°Did your father speak of it?¡± inquired Merc¨¦d¨¨s eagerly.

¡°No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?¡±

20269m


¡°Yes, I do remember,¡± replied the countess.

A servant entered, summoned by Albert¡¯s ring of the bell.

¡°Take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing-room,¡± said the
viscount; ¡°they make the countess ill.¡±

The footman obeyed his orders. A long pause ensued, which lasted until
all the flowers were removed.

¡°What is this name of Monte Cristo?¡± inquired the countess, when the
servant had taken away the last vase of flowers, ¡°is it a family name,
or the name of the estate, or a simple title?¡±

¡°I believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an island
in the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you today, has founded a
commandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of
Florence, Saint George Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order of
Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls himself
a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that the count
is a man of very high distinction.¡±

¡°His manners are admirable,¡± said the countess, ¡°at least, as far as I
could judge in the few minutes he remained here.¡±

¡°They are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I
have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities
of Europe¡ªthe English, the Spanish, and the German.¡±

The countess paused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she
resumed.

¡°You have seen, my dear Albert¡ªI ask the question as a mother¡ªyou have
seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much
knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you
think the count is really what he appears to be?¡±

¡°What does he appear to be?¡±

¡°Why, you have just said,¡ªa man of high distinction.¡±

¡°I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.¡±

¡°But what is your own opinion, Albert?¡±

¡°I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting
him, but I think him a Maltese.¡±

¡°I do not ask you of his origin but what he is.¡±

¡°Ah! what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many
remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I
think, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron¡¯s
heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some
Lara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient
family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the
force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws
of society.¡±

¡°You say¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the Mediterranean,
without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of all nations,
and pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not these industrious
worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection?¡±

¡°That is possible,¡± said the countess, reflecting.

¡°Never mind,¡± continued the young man, ¡°smuggler or not, you must agree,
mother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte Cristo is a
remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the salons of
Paris. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his entr¨¦e amongst
us by striking every man of us with amazement, not even excepting
Chateau-Renaud.¡±

¡°And what do you suppose is the count¡¯s age?¡± inquired Merc¨¦d¨¨s,
evidently attaching great importance to this question.

¡°Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.¡±

¡°So young,¡ªit is impossible,¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s, replying at the same time
to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.

¡°It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and
certainly without the slightest premeditation, ¡®at such a period I was
five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,¡¯ and I,
induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have
compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this
singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.
Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair, and
his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,¡ªhe is not only
vigorous, but also young.¡±

The countess bent her head, as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter
thoughts.

¡°And has this man displayed a friendship for you, Albert?¡± she asked
with a nervous shudder.

¡°I am inclined to think so.¡±

¡°And¡ªdo¡ªyou¡ªlike¡ªhim?¡±

¡°Why, he pleases me in spite of Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay, who tries to convince me
that he is a being returned from the other world.¡±

The countess shuddered.

¡°Albert,¡± she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion, ¡°I have
always put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now you are a
man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert, be
prudent.¡±

¡°Why, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice turn
to account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust. The
count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little
sherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at me,
try to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?¡±

¡°You are right,¡± said the countess, ¡°and my fears are weakness,
especially when directed against a man who has saved your life. How did
your father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be more
than complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his
business makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Nothing could be in better taste than my father¡¯s demeanor, madame,¡±
said Albert; ¡°nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three
compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with
as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each of these
little tickling arrows must have pleased my father,¡± added Albert with a
laugh. ¡°And thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de
Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers.¡±

The countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a reverie that her
eyes gradually closed. The young man, standing up before her, gazed upon
her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with
children whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then, after seeing
her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she had
dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door after
him with the utmost precaution.

¡°This devil of a fellow,¡± he muttered, shaking his head; ¡°I said at the
time he would create a sensation here, and I measure his effect by an
infallible thermometer. My mother has noticed him, and he must
therefore, perforce, be remarkable.¡±

He went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he
remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a
¡°turnout¡± which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of
connoisseurs.

¡°Most decidedly,¡± said he, ¡°men are not equal, and I must beg my father
to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.¡±






Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio

Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six
minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient
to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had
been unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in
order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs
apiece for his horses.

The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to
Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the Champs-
¨¦lys¨¦es. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre, and
masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys, like
two arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive from the
iron gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a porcelain
vase, filled with flowers. This house, isolated from the rest, had,
besides the main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu. Even before
the coachman had hailed the concierge, the massy gates rolled on their
hinges¡ªthey had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as everywhere else,
he was served with the rapidity of lightning. The coachman entered and
traversed the half-circle without slackening his speed, and the gates
were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel. The
carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two men presented
themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who, smiling with an
expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid by a mere look
from Monte Cristo. The other bowed respectfully, and offered his arm to
assist the count in descending.

¡°Thanks, M. Bertuccio,¡± said the count, springing lightly up the three
steps of the portico; ¡°and the notary?¡±

¡°He is in the small salon, excellency,¡± returned Bertuccio.

¡°And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number
of the house?¡±

¡°Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best
engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The
first card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron
Danglars, Rue de la Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin, No. 7; the others are on the
mantle-piece of your excellency¡¯s bedroom.¡±

¡°Good; what o¡¯clock is it?¡±

¡°Four o¡¯clock.¡±

Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman
who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf¡¯s, and then he
passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the
way.

¡°These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,¡± said Monte
Cristo. ¡°I trust all this will soon be taken away.¡±

Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the
small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer¡¯s clerk, elevated to the
extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener.

¡°You are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to
purchase, monsieur?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°Yes, count,¡± returned the notary.

¡°Is the deed of sale ready?¡±

¡°Yes, count.¡±

¡°Have you brought it?¡±

¡°Here it is.¡±

¡°Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?¡± asked the count
carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.
The steward made a gesture that signified, ¡°I do not know.¡± The notary
looked at the count with astonishment.

¡°What!¡± said he, ¡°does not the count know where the house he purchases
is situated?¡±

¡°No,¡± returned the count.

¡°The count does not know?¡±

¡°How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have never
before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set my
foot in France.¡±

¡°Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.¡±

At these words Bertuccio turned pale.

¡°And where is Auteuil?¡± asked the count.

¡°Close by here, monsieur,¡± replied the notary¡ª¡°a little beyond Passy; a
charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.¡±

¡°So near as that?¡± said the Count; ¡°but that is not in the country. What
made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?¡±

¡°I,¡± cried the steward with a strange expression. ¡°His excellency did
not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will
recollect¡ªif he will think¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Ah, true,¡± observed Monte Cristo; ¡°I recollect now. I read the
advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title,
¡®a country house.¡¯¡±

¡°It is not yet too late,¡± cried Bertuccio, eagerly; ¡°and if your
excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a better
at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± returned Monte Cristo negligently; ¡°since I have this, I will
keep it.¡±

¡°And you are quite right,¡± said the notary, who feared to lose his fee.
¡°It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine trees;
a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time, without
reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable, now that
old things are so much sought after. I suppose the count has the tastes
of the day?¡±

¡°To be sure,¡± returned Monte Cristo; ¡°it is very convenient, then?¡±

¡°It is more¡ªit is magnificent.¡±

¡°Peste! let us not lose such an opportunity,¡± returned Monte Cristo.
¡°The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.¡±

And he signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part
of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the
names of the proprietors.

¡°Bertuccio,¡± said he, ¡°give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur.¡±

The steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a
bundle of bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never
gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there.

¡°And now,¡± demanded the count, ¡°are all the forms complied with?¡±

¡°All, sir.¡±

¡°Have you the keys?¡±

¡°They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house,
but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new
possessions.¡±

¡°Very well;¡± and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary,
which said, ¡°I have no further need of you; you may go.¡±

¡°But,¡± observed the honest notary, ¡°the count is, I think, mistaken; it
is only fifty thousand francs, everything included.¡±

¡°And your fee?¡±

¡°Is included in this sum.¡±

¡°But have you not come from Auteuil here?¡±

¡°Yes, certainly.¡±

¡°Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of
time and trouble,¡± said the count; and he made a gesture of polite
dismissal.

The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the ground; it
was the first time he had ever met a similar client.

¡°See this gentleman out,¡± said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward
followed the notary out of the room.

Scarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book closed
with a lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck, and
which never left him. After having sought for a few minutes, he stopped
at a leaf which had several notes, and compared them with the deed of
sale, which lay on the table, and recalling his souvenirs¡ª

¡°¡®Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;¡¯ it is indeed the same,¡± said he;
¡°and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical
terror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!¡± cried he,
striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.
¡°Bertuccio!¡±

The steward appeared at the door.

¡°Monsieur Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°did you never tell me that you
had travelled in France?¡±

¡°In some parts of France¡ªyes, excellency.¡±

¡°You know the environs of Paris, then?¡±

¡°No, excellency, no,¡± returned the steward, with a sort of nervous
trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly
attributed to great disquietude.

¡°It is unfortunate,¡± returned he, ¡°that you have never visited the
environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you
gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.¡±

¡°To Auteuil!¡± cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid¡ª¡°I
go to Auteuil?¡±

¡°Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you
must come there, as you belong to my service.¡±

Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master,
and remained motionless, without making any answer.

¡°Why, what has happened to you?¡ªare you going to make me ring a second
time for the carriage?¡± asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis
XIV. pronounced the famous, ¡°I have been almost obliged to wait.¡±
Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse
voice:

¡°His excellency¡¯s horses!¡±

Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the
steward appeared.

¡°Your excellency¡¯s carriage is at the door,¡± said he.

¡°Well, take your hat and gloves,¡± returned Monte Cristo.

¡°Am I to accompany you, your excellency?¡± cried Bertuccio.

¡°Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the
house.¡±

20277m


It was unexampled for a servant of the count¡¯s to dare to dispute an
order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his
master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which he
did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.






Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil

Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio
signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of
the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the
carriage, muttered a short prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless
thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward¡¯s
extraordinary repugnance for the count¡¯s projected drive without the
walls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this
little journey. In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the steward¡¯s
emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village. Bertuccio,
crouched in the corner of the carriage, began to examine with a feverish
anxiety every house they passed.

¡°Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28,¡± said the count,
fixing his eyes on the steward, to whom he gave this order.

Bertuccio¡¯s forehead was covered with perspiration; however, he obeyed,
and, leaning out of the window, he cried to the coachman,¡ª¡°Rue de la
Fontaine, No. 28.¡± No. 28 was situated at the extremity of the village;
during the drive night had set in, and darkness gave the surroundings
the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage. The carriage stopped,
the footman sprang off the box and opened the door.

¡°Well,¡± said the count, ¡°you do not get out, M. Bertuccio¡ªyou are going
to stay in the carriage, then? What are you thinking of this evening?¡±

Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his shoulder to the count, who, this
time, leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage.

¡°Knock,¡± said the count, ¡°and announce me.¡±

Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.

¡°What is it?¡± asked he.

¡°It is your new master, my good fellow,¡± said the footman. And he held
out to the concierge the notary¡¯s order.

¡°The house is sold, then?¡± demanded the concierge; ¡°and this gentleman
is coming to live here?¡±

¡°Yes, my friend,¡± returned the count; ¡°and I will endeavor to give you
no cause to regret your old master.¡±

¡°Oh, monsieur,¡± said the concierge, ¡°I shall not have much cause to
regret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was
here last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him
in anything at all.¡±

¡°What was the name of your old master?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°The Marquis of Saint-M¨¦ran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house for
what he gave for it.¡±

¡°The Marquis of Saint-M¨¦ran!¡± returned the count. ¡°The name is not
unknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-M¨¦ran!¡± and he appeared to meditate.

¡°An old gentleman,¡± continued the concierge, ¡°a staunch follower of the
Bourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had
been the king¡¯s attorney at N?mes, and afterwards at Versailles.¡±

Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall
against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling.

¡°And is not this daughter dead?¡± demanded Monte Cristo; ¡°I fancy I have
heard so.¡±

¡°Yes, monsieur, one-and-twenty years ago; and since then we have not
seen the poor marquis three times.¡±

¡°Thanks, thanks,¡± said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward¡¯s utter
prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of
breaking it. ¡°Give me a light.¡±

¡°Shall I accompany you, monsieur?¡±

¡°No, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light.¡±

And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces,
which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge.

¡°Ah, monsieur,¡± said he, after having vainly searched on the mantle-
piece and the shelves, ¡°I have not got any candles.¡±

¡°Take one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°and show
me the apartments.¡±

The steward obeyed in silence, but it was easy to see, from the manner
in which the hand that held the light trembled, how much it cost him to
obey. They went over a tolerably large ground floor; a first floor
consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near one of the
bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden.

¡°Ah, here is a private staircase,¡± said the count; ¡°that is convenient.
Light me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± replied Bertuccio, ¡°it leads to the garden.¡±

¡°And, pray, how do you know that?¡±

¡°It ought to do so, at least.¡±

¡°Well, let us be sure of that.¡±

Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to the
garden. At the outer door the steward paused.

¡°Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio,¡± said the count.

But he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned;
his haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some
terrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut
out horrible recollections.

¡°Well!¡± insisted the Count.

¡°No, no,¡± cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the
interior wall. ¡°No, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.¡±

¡°What does this mean?¡± demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.

¡°Why, you must see, your excellency,¡± cried the steward, ¡°that this is
not natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly
at Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be No.
28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all? I am sure you
would not have forced me to come. I hoped your house would have been
some other one than this; as if there was not another house at Auteuil
than that of the assassination!¡±

¡°What, what!¡± cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, ¡°what words do you
utter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you are¡ªalways mysteries or
superstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you
are not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?¡±

Bertuccio raised the lantern, and obeyed. The door, as it opened,
disclosed a gloomy sky, in which the moon strove vainly to struggle
through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she
illumined for an instant, only to sink into obscurity. The steward
wished to turn to the left.

¡°No, no, monsieur,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°What is the use of following the
alleys? Here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards.¡±

Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he
continued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took the
right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward could
not restrain himself.

¡°Move, monsieur¡ªmove away, I entreat you; you are exactly in the spot!¡±

¡°What spot?¡±

¡°Where he fell.¡±

20281m


¡°My dear Monsieur Bertuccio,¡± said Monte Cristo, laughing, ¡°control
yourself; we are not at Sart¨¨ne or at Corte. This is not a Corsican
maquis but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still you must not
calumniate it for that.¡±

¡°Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!¡±

¡°I think you are going mad, Bertuccio,¡± said the count coldly. ¡°If that
is the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum.¡±

¡°Alas! excellency,¡± returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking
his head in a manner that would have excited the count¡¯s laughter, had
not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him
attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience. ¡°Alas!
excellency, the evil has arrived!¡±

¡°M. Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°I am very glad to tell you, that while
you gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man
possessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always observed,
that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I knew you
were a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding over some
old history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy, because in
Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France they are
considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves
with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which avenge.¡±

Bertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did not
let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered countenance.
Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at Rome, he had bent
upon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone that made a shudder
pass through the veins of the poor steward¡ª

¡°The Abb¨¦ Busoni, then told me an untruth,¡± said he, ¡°when, after his
journey in France, in 1829, he sent you to me, with a letter of
recommendation, in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities.
Well, I shall write to the abb¨¦; I shall hold him responsible for his
prot¨¦g¨¦¡¯s misconduct, and I shall soon know all about this
assassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in a country, I
conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself within the
compass of the French laws for your sake.¡±

¡°Oh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,¡±
cried Bertuccio, in despair. ¡°I have always been an honest man, and, as
far as lay in my power, I have done good.¡±

¡°I do not deny it,¡± returned the count; ¡°but why are you thus agitated.
It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in
the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.¡±

¡°But, your excellency,¡± replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, ¡°did not the
Abb¨¦ Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at N?mes, tell you
that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?¡±

¡°Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded
you had stolen¡ªthat was all.¡±

¡°Oh, your excellency!¡± returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.

¡°Or, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the
desire of making a ¡®stiff,¡¯ as you call it.¡±

¡°Yes, my good master,¡± cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the count¡¯s
feet, ¡°it was simply vengeance¡ªnothing else.¡±

¡°I understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes
you in this manner.¡±

¡°But, monsieur, it is very natural,¡± returned Bertuccio, ¡°since it was
in this house that my vengeance was accomplished.¡±

¡°What! my house?¡±

¡°Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.¡±

¡°Whose, then? The Marquis de Saint-M¨¦ran, I think, the concierge said.
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡±

¡°Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.¡±

¡°This is strange,¡± returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his
reflections, ¡°that you should find yourself without any preparation in a
house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± said the steward, ¡°it is fatality, I am sure. First, you
purchase a house at Auteuil¡ªthis house is the one where I have committed
an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by
which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received the blow; and
two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child.
This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too much like
Providence.¡±

¡°Well, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is Providence. I always
suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something
to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.¡±

¡°I have related it but once, and that was to the Abb¨¦ Busoni. Such
things,¡± continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, ¡°are only related under
the seal of confession.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said the count, ¡°I refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux
or Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like
anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my
servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I confess
I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police, for, in
Italy, justice is only paid when silent¡ªin France she is paid only when
she speaks. Peste! I thought you somewhat Corsican, a great deal
smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have other strings to
your bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur Bertuccio.¡±

¡°Oh, your excellency, your excellency!¡± cried the steward, struck with
terror at this threat, ¡°if that is the only reason I cannot remain in
your service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go
to the scaffold.¡±

¡°That is different,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°but if you intend to tell an
untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.¡±

¡°No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell you
all, for the Abb¨¦ Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret; but, I
pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just bursting
through the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and wrapped in
that cloak that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de Villefort.¡±

¡°What!¡± cried Monte Cristo, ¡°it was M. de Villefort?¡±

¡°Your excellency knows him?¡±

¡°The former royal attorney at N?mes?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Who married the Marquis of Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s daughter?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright,
the most rigid magistrate on the bench?¡±

¡°Well, monsieur,¡± said Bertuccio, ¡°this man with this spotless
reputation¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Was a villain.¡±

¡°Bah,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°impossible!¡±

¡°It is as I tell you.¡±

¡°Ah, really,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°Have you proof of this?¡±

¡°I had it.¡±

¡°And you have lost it; how stupid!¡±

¡°Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.¡±

¡°Really,¡± returned the count, ¡°relate it to me, for it begins to
interest me.¡±

And the count, humming an air from Lucia, went to sit down on a bench,
while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts. Bertuccio
remained standing before him.

Chapter 44. The Vendetta

At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?¡± asked Bertuccio.

¡°Where you please,¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°since I know nothing at all
of it.¡±

¡°I thought the Abb¨¦ Busoni had told your excellency.¡±

¡°Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and
I have forgotten them.¡±

¡°Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.¡±

¡°Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.¡±

¡°The story begins in 1815.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°1815 is not yesterday.¡±

¡°No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had
happened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the
service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed
entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became
orphans¡ªI at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been his
son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the Island
of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly wounded at
Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.¡±

¡°But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,¡± said the
count; ¡°unless I am mistaken, it has been already written.¡±

¡°Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you
promised to be patient.¡±

¡°Go on; I will keep my word.¡±

¡°One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the
little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cap Corse. This letter
was from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he
should return by Chateauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and N?mes; and,
if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at N?mes, with an
innkeeper with whom I had dealings.¡±

¡°In the smuggling line?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Eh, your excellency? Everyone must live.¡±

¡°Certainly; go on.¡±

¡°I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved
not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a
thousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and
with the other five hundred I set off for N?mes. It was easy to do so,
and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored
my project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became
contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter
the Rh?ne. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles. I
left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the road to
N?mes.¡±

¡°We are getting to the story now?¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you
what is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres
took place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,
Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they
suspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres,
your excellency?¡±

¡°Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.¡±

¡°As I entered N?mes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you
encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered,
and burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became
terrified, not for myself¡ªfor I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had
nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us
smugglers¡ªbut for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from
the army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was
everything to apprehend. I hastened to the innkeeper. My misgivings had
been but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at N?mes,
and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand
hospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to discover
the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much were they
dreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so
much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king¡¯s attorney.¡±

¡°And this king¡¯s attorney was named Villefort?¡± asked Monte Cristo
carelessly.

¡°Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been deputy
procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was said to be
one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from
the Island of Elba.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°you went to him?¡±

¡°¡®Monsieur,¡¯ I said, ¡®my brother was assassinated yesterday in the
streets of N?mes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.
You are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to
avenge those she has been unable to protect.¡¯

¡°¡®Who was your brother?¡¯ asked he.

¡°¡®A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.¡¯

¡°¡®A soldier of the usurper, then?¡¯

¡°¡®A soldier of the French army.¡¯

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ replied he, ¡®he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished
by the sword.¡¯

¡°¡®You are mistaken, monsieur,¡¯ I replied; ¡®he has perished by the
poniard.¡¯

¡°¡®What do you want me to do?¡¯ asked the magistrate.

¡°¡®I have already told you¡ªavenge him.¡¯

¡°¡®On whom?¡¯

¡°¡®On his murderers.¡¯

¡°¡®How should I know who they are?¡¯

¡°¡®Order them to be sought for.¡¯

¡°¡®Why, your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a
duel. All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the
time of the emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here
do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct.¡¯

¡°¡®Monsieur,¡¯ I replied, ¡®it is not for myself that I entreat your
interference¡ªI should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother
had a wife, and were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would
perish from want, for my brother¡¯s pay alone kept her. Pray, try and
obtain a small government pension for her.¡¯

¡°¡®Every revolution has its catastrophes,¡¯ returned M. de Villefort;
¡®your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and
government owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the
vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans
of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would
be today, in all probability, condemned to death. What has happened is
quite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.¡¯

¡°¡®What,¡¯ cried I, ¡®do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?¡¯

¡°¡®All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,¡¯ replied M. de Villefort;
¡®they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken
the time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too late
now. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.¡¯

¡°I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from
further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said
in a low voice, ¡®Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know
that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed to
kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.
Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,
that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against
you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet
your last hour has come.¡¯ And before he had recovered from his surprise,
I opened the door and left the room.¡±

¡°Well, well,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°such an innocent looking person as you
are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king¡¯s attorney at that!
But did he know what was meant by the terrible word ¡®vendetta¡¯?¡±

¡°He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,
and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I
was so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became alarmed,
and dared not stay any longer at N?mes, so he solicited a change of
residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated
to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to avenge
himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was
never above half a day¡¯s journey before me, who followed him on foot.
The most important thing was, not to kill him only¡ªfor I had an
opportunity of doing so a hundred times¡ªbut to kill him without being
discovered¡ªat least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged to
myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.

¡°For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took
not a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I discovered
that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him thither, and I saw
him enter the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the
great door that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his
carriage, left the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by
the gate you see there.¡±

Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in
the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded.

¡°As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and
gained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was
evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged, as
the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-M¨¦ran,
Villefort¡¯s father-in-law. M. de Saint-M¨¦ran lived at Marseilles, so
that this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be
let to a young widow, known only by the name of ¡®the Baroness.¡¯

¡°One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome
woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by
any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort. When
she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features, I saw she
was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose
muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere
long become a mother. A few moments after, the little door was opened
and a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They threw
themselves into each other¡¯s arms, embraced tenderly, and returned
together to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully believed
that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the
whole of the garden alone.¡±

20291m


¡°And,¡± asked the count, ¡°did you ever know the name of this woman?¡±

¡°No, excellency,¡± returned Bertuccio; ¡°you will see that I had no time
to learn it.¡±

¡°Go on.¡±

¡°That evening,¡± continued Bertuccio, ¡°I could have killed the procureur,
but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was
fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were
overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and
in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into
the street bordered by the wall of the garden. Three days after, about
seven o¡¯clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the
house at full gallop, and take the road to S¨¨vres. I concluded that he
was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived. Three hours later, the
man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two
minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the
little door of the garden, which he closed after him. I descended
rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort¡¯s face, I recognized him by
the beating of my heart. I crossed the street, and stopped at a post
placed at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before
looked into the garden.

¡°This time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife
out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the
wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it,
taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock. Nothing,
then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds. The
garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the
middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy
foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers. In order to
go from the door to the house, or from the house to the door, M. de
Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees.

20293m


¡°It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint
glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds
that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led to
the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick
shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of
discovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must
take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I fancied
I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your
excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that
he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours passed
thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight struck.
As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through the
windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended. The
door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared.

¡°The terrible moment had come, but I had so long been prepared for it
that my heart did not fail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket
again, opened it, and made ready to strike. The man in the mantle
advanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in
his hand. I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure. When he was
only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was
only a spade. I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de
Villefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the
thicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the
earth. I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle,
which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely. Then, I confess,
curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort was going
to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath. Then an idea
crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from
under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or eight inches deep. I
let him place the box in the hole he had made, then, while he stamped
with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation, I rushed on him
and plunged my knife into his breast, exclaiming:

¡°¡®I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my brother¡¯s; thy treasure for
his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had
hoped.¡¯

¡°I know not if he heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell
without a cry. I felt his blood gush over my face, but I was
intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood refreshed, instead of
burning me. In a second I had disinterred the box; then, that it might
not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole, threw the spade over
the wall, and rushed through the door, which I double-locked, carrying
off the key.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°it seems to me this was nothing but murder and
robbery.¡±

¡°No, your excellency,¡± returned Bertuccio; ¡°it was a vendetta followed
by restitution.¡±

¡°And was the sum a large one?¡±

¡°It was not money.¡±

¡°Ah, I recollect,¡± replied the count; ¡°did you not say something of an
infant?¡±

¡°Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and
with my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth was
wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored
hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not
yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart,
and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a
doctor would have done¡ªI inflated the lungs by blowing air into them,
and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and
cried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy.

¡°¡®God has not cursed me then,¡¯ I cried, ¡®since he permits me to save the
life of a human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken away.¡¯¡±

20295m


¡°And what did you do with the child?¡± asked Monte Cristo. ¡°It was an
embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.¡±

¡°I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris
there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I passed the
city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I
inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen
proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which
I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone
else. No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum, which
was situated at the upper end of the Rue d¡¯Enfer, and after having taken
the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one of the
two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child,
while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and fled
with all speed. A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to
Assunta:

¡°¡®Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.¡¯

¡°She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,¡ª¡®Giovanni,¡¯
said she, ¡®you should have brought this child with you; we would have
replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in
consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.¡¯ In reply I
gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we
became rich.¡±

¡°What letters were marked on the linen?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°An H and an N, surmounted by a baron¡¯s coronet.¡±

¡°By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you
study heraldry?¡±

¡°In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.¡±

¡°Go on, I am curious to know two things.¡±

¡°What are they, your excellency?¡±

¡°What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy,
M. Bertuccio.¡±

¡°No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.¡±

¡°I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.¡±

¡°No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your
excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?¡±

¡°The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a
confessor, and the Abb¨¦ Busoni came to visit you at your request in the
prison at N?mes.¡±

¡°The story will be very long, excellency.¡±

¡°What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you
are very much inclined for it either.¡± Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his
story.

¡°Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly
to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade of
smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws
which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were ill-
watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were
perpetually breaking out in Avignon, N?mes, or Uz¨¨s. We profited by this
respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere. Since
my brother¡¯s assassination in the streets of N?mes, I had never entered
the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected,
seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to come to us,
and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from Bellegarde to
Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus, at Aigues-
Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our goods, and
where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes
and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade, when a
certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself,
brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing the
gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the judges
would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the past.
And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the
selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit. So,
preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most astonishing deeds,
and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we take of
our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which
require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution. In
reality, when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises, you
are no longer the equal of other men, or, rather, other men are no
longer your equals, and whosoever has taken this resolution, feels his
strength and resources doubled.¡±

¡°Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,¡± interrupted the count; ¡°you have done a
little of everything in your life.¡±

¡°Oh, excellency!¡±

¡°No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet
I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which
is more than can be said for all philosophy.¡±

¡°My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive. Assunta
took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as I was
setting off on an expedition, ¡®Go,¡¯ said she; ¡®at your return I will
give you a surprise.¡¯ I questioned her, but in vain; she would tell me
nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had
been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English cottons, and we ran
our cargo without opposition, and returned home full of joy. When I
entered the house, the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assunta¡¯s
chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the
rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or eight months old. I
uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I had known since the
assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I
had abandoned this child. For the assassination itself I had never felt
any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She had profited by my
absence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and having written
down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum,
had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No objection was raised,
and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I confess, your excellency, when
I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle, I felt my
eyes filled with tears. ¡®Ah, Assunta,¡¯ cried I, ¡®you are an excellent
woman, and Heaven will bless you.¡¯¡±

¡°This,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°is less correct than your philosophy,¡ªit is
only faith.¡±

¡°Alas, your excellency is right,¡± replied Bertuccio, ¡°and God made this
infant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature
declare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault
in his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of
that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only
his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression,
and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.

¡°Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that ¡®red is either
altogether good or altogether bad.¡¯ The proverb was but too correct as
regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst
disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother
encouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the
town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the
most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese
preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor¡¯s orchard, or the dried
apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples
that grew in my garden.

¡°One day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor Wasilio,
who, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his purse
or his valuables¡ªfor, as your excellency knows, there are no thieves in
Corsica¡ªcomplained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we thought
he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but he persisted in
the accuracy of his statement. One day, Benedetto, who had been gone
from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not return until
late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he said he had
found chained to the foot of a tree. For more than a month past, the
mischievous child, who knew not what to wish for, had taken it into his
head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had passed by Rogliano, and who
had several of these animals, whose tricks had greatly diverted him,
had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him. ¡®Monkeys are not found in
our woods chained to trees,¡¯ said I; ¡®confess how you obtained this
animal.¡¯ Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said, and
accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than
to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I threatened to
strike him, and he made two steps backwards. ¡®You cannot beat me,¡¯ said
he; ¡®you have no right, for you are not my father.¡¯

20299m


¡°We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so
carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the
child¡¯s whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and
my arm fell without touching him.

¡°The boy triumphed, and this victory rendered him so audacious, that all
the money of Assunta, whose affection for him seemed to increase as he
became more unworthy of it, was spent in caprices she knew not how to
contend against, and follies she had not the courage to prevent. When I
was at Rogliano everything went on properly, but no sooner was my back
turned than Benedetto became master, and everything went ill. When he
was only eleven, he chose his companions from among the young men of
eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia, or, indeed, in
Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks, been several
times threatened with a prosecution. I became alarmed, as any
prosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was
compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition;
I reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some
impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.

¡°I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the
severe discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his
character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt. I spoke to
Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me, endeavoring to
tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a
child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had finished, burst
out laughing.

¡°¡®Are you mad, uncle?¡¯ (he called me by this name when he was in good
humor); ¡®do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode
of existence¡ªmy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you
impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and the
scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you are
perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum? Why, I
have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me when I
ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.¡¯

¡°The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto
rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to
them as a fool.¡±

¡°Sweet child,¡± murmured Monte Cristo.

¡°Oh, had he been my own son,¡± replied Bertuccio, ¡°or even my nephew, I
would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that
you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was
striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me to
punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate
boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed
money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to
conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made up.
Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit
seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. My intention
was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know
anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means
his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. I set off for
France, after having fixed upon the plan. Our cargo was to be landed in
the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was
then the year 1829. The most perfect tranquillity was restored, and the
vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled, and their
strictness was increased at this time, in consequence of the fair at
Beaucaire.

20301m


¡°Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our vessel¡ªwhich
had a double hold, where our goods were concealed¡ªamidst a number of
other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rh?ne from Beaucaire to
Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night, and
to convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper with whom we
were connected.

¡°Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I
know not; but one evening, about five o¡¯clock, our little cabin-boy came
breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom-house
officers advancing in our direction. It was not their proximity that
alarmed us, for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks
of the Rh?ne, but the care, according to the boy¡¯s account, that they
took to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on the alert, but it was
too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst the custom-house
officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as terrified at the sight of
their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other, I sprang into
the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the river, dived, and only
rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a ditch that had recently
been made from the Rh?ne to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to
Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along the ditch without
being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had designedly taken
this direction. I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from
N?mes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to
Beaucaire.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°I perfectly recollect him; I think he was your
colleague.¡±

¡°Precisely,¡± answered Bertuccio; ¡°but he had, seven or eight years
before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,
who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his
fortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the
new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I
intended to ask shelter.¡±

¡°What was his name?¡± inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat
interested in Bertuccio¡¯s story.

¡°Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of
Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her
village. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by
inches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five-
and-forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof
of his presence of mind and courage.¡±

¡°And you say,¡± interrupted Monte Cristo ¡°that this took place towards
the year¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°1829, your excellency.¡±

¡°In what month?¡±

¡°June.¡±

¡°The beginning or the end?¡±

¡°The evening of the 3rd.¡±

20303m


¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°the evening of the 3rd of June, 1829. Go on.¡±

¡°It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we
never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to
break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept
amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might
have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed
the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in
which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity
of announcing our presence.

¡°My intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with my
presence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted, and
profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rh?ne, and ascertain the
state of our vessel and its crew. I stepped into the shed, and it was
fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse entered with a
stranger.

¡°I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I could
do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. The
man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of
France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the
Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during
which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all
parts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000
francs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing that the room was, as
usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife,
¡®Hello, Carconte,¡¯ said he, ¡®the worthy priest has not deceived us; the
diamond is real.¡¯

¡°An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase creaked beneath a
feeble step. ¡®What do you say?¡¯ asked his wife, pale as death.

¡°¡®I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the
first jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000 francs for it. Only, in
order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to
relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which
the diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit
down, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.¡¯

¡°The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the
apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond
that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince.

¡°¡®Relate your story, madame,¡¯ said he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by
the absence of the husband, so that the latter could not influence the
wife¡¯s story, to see if the two recitals tallied.

¡°¡®Oh,¡¯ returned she, ¡®it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great
friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dant¨¨s. This poor
fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his
death he bequeathed this diamond to him.¡¯

¡°¡®But how did he obtain it?¡¯ asked the jeweller; ¡®had he it before he
was imprisoned?¡¯

¡°¡®No, monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance
of a rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dant¨¨s took the
same care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman, when he
was set free, gave this stone to Dant¨¨s, who, less fortunate, died, and,
in his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abb¨¦, who was here
this morning, to deliver it.¡¯

¡°¡®The same story,¡¯ muttered the jeweller; ¡®and improbable as it seemed
at first, it may be true. There¡¯s only the price we are not agreed
about.¡¯

¡°¡®How not agreed about?¡¯ said Caderousse. ¡®I thought we agreed for the
price I asked.¡¯

¡°¡®That is,¡¯ replied the jeweller, ¡®I offered 40,000 francs.¡¯

¡®Forty thousand,¡¯ cried La Carconte; ¡®we will not part with it for that
sum. The abb¨¦ told us it was worth 50,000 without the setting.¡¯

¡°¡®What was the abb¨¦¡¯s name?¡¯ asked the indefatigable questioner.

¡°¡®The Abb¨¦ Busoni,¡¯ said La Carconte.

¡°¡®He was a foreigner?¡¯

¡°¡®An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.¡¯

¡°¡®Let me see this diamond again,¡¯ replied the jeweller; ¡®the first time
you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.¡¯

¡°Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen, opened,
and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight of the diamond, which was as
large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte¡¯s eyes sparkled with cupidity.¡±

¡°And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?¡± said Monte
Cristo; ¡°did you credit it?¡±

¡°Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I
thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.¡±

¡°That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.
Bertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dant¨¨s, of whom they spoke?¡±

¡°No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but
once afterwards, and that was from the Abb¨¦ Busoni himself, when I saw
him in the prison at N?mes.¡±

¡°Go on.¡±

¡°The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel
pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its
setting, and weighed it carefully.

¡°¡®I will give you 45,000,¡¯ said he, ¡®but not a sou more; besides, as
that is the exact value of the stone, I brought just that sum with me.¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, that¡¯s no matter,¡¯ replied Caderousse, ¡®I will go back with you to
fetch the other 5,000 francs.¡¯

¡°¡®No,¡¯ returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to
Caderousse, ¡®no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much,
for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However, I will
not go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.¡¯

¡°¡®At least, replace the diamond in the ring,¡¯ said La Carconte sharply.

¡°¡®Ah, true,¡¯ replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.

¡°¡®No matter,¡¯ observed Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket,
¡®someone else will purchase it.¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ continued the jeweller; ¡®but someone else will not be so easy as
I am, or content himself with the same story. It is not natural that a
man like you should possess such a diamond. He will inform against you.
You will have to find the Abb¨¦ Busoni; and abb¨¦s who give diamonds worth
two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it, and put you in
prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty,
the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs, will be
given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000 francs;
from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in
purchasing.¡¯

¡°Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.

¡°¡®No,¡¯ said Caderousse, ¡®we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.¡¯

¡°¡®As you please, my dear sir,¡¯ said the jeweller; ¡®I had, however, as
you see, brought you the money in bright coin.¡¯ And he drew from his
pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes
of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.

¡°There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it was
plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in his
hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum
which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife.

¡°¡®What do you think of this?¡¯ he asked in a low voice.

¡°¡®Let him have it¡ªlet him have it,¡¯ she said. ¡®If he returns to
Beaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he
says, who knows if we shall ever again see the Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡ªin all
probability we shall never see him.¡¯

¡°¡®Well, then, so I will!¡¯ said Caderousse; ¡®so you may have the diamond
for 45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of
silver buckles.¡¯

¡°The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box, which contained
several samples of the articles demanded. ¡®Here,¡¯ he said, ¡®I am very
straightforward in my dealings¡ªtake your choice.¡¯

¡°The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband
a pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.

¡°¡®I hope you will not complain now?¡¯ said the jeweller.

¡°¡®The abb¨¦ told me it was worth 50,000 francs,¡¯ muttered Caderousse.

¡°¡®Come, come¡ªgive it to me! What a strange fellow you are,¡¯ said the
jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. ¡®I give you 45,000
francs¡ªthat is, 2,500 livres of income,¡ªa fortune such as I wish I had
myself, and you are not satisfied!¡¯

¡°¡®And the five-and-forty thousand francs,¡¯ inquired Caderousse in a
hoarse voice, ¡®where are they? Come¡ªlet us see them.¡¯

¡°¡®Here they are,¡¯ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the
table 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.

¡°¡®Wait while I light the lamp,¡¯ said La Carconte; ¡®it is growing dark,
and there may be some mistake.¡¯ In fact, night had come on during this
conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for
the last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was
apparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte,
absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt; a
strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these
bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it always
happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot. Caderousse
counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed them to
his wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. During this
time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight,
and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those
which¡ªprecursors of the storm¡ªbegan to play in at the windows.

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ inquired the jeweller, ¡®is the cash all right?¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ said Caderousse. ¡®Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and find
a bag somewhere.¡¯

¡°La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern
pocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters, and
put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three
crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire
fortune of the miserable couple.

¡°¡®There,¡¯ said Caderousse; ¡®and now, although you have wronged us of
perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have your supper with us? I invite you
with good-will.¡¯

¡°¡®Thank you,¡¯ replied the jeweller, ¡®it must be getting late, and I must
return to Beaucaire¡ªmy wife will be getting uneasy.¡¯ He drew out his
watch, and exclaimed, ¡®Morbleu! nearly nine o¡¯clock¡ªwhy, I shall not get
back to Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If the Abb¨¦
Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.¡¯

¡°¡®In another week you will have left Beaucaire,¡¯ remarked Caderousse,
¡®for the fair ends in a few days.¡¯

¡°¡®True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to M.
Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the
journey on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.¡¯

¡°At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a
flash of lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the
lamp.

20307m


¡°¡®See here,¡¯ exclaimed Caderousse. ¡®You cannot think of going out in
such weather as this.¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,¡¯ said the jeweller.

¡°¡®And then there are robbers,¡¯ said La Carconte. ¡®The road is never very
safe during fair time.¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, as to the robbers,¡¯ said Joannes, ¡®here is something for them,¡¯
and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the
muzzle. ¡®Here,¡¯ said he, ¡®are dogs who bark and bite at the same time,
they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond,
Friend Caderousse.¡¯

¡°Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed as
though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible
thought. ¡®Well, then, a good journey to you,¡¯ said Caderousse.

¡°¡®Thanks,¡¯ replied the jeweller. He then took his cane, which he had
placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment when he
opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly
extinguished. ¡®Oh,¡¯ said he, ¡®this is very nice weather, and two leagues
to go in such a storm.¡¯

¡°¡®Remain,¡¯ said Caderousse. ¡®You can sleep here.¡¯

¡°¡®Yes; do stay,¡¯ added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; ¡®we will take
every care of you.¡¯

¡°¡®No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So, once more, good-night.¡¯ Caderousse
followed him slowly to the threshold. ¡®I can see neither heaven nor
earth,¡¯ said the jeweller, who was outside the door. ¡®Do I turn to the
right, or to the left hand?¡¯

¡°¡®To the right,¡¯ said Caderousse. ¡®You cannot go wrong¡ªthe road is
bordered by trees on both sides.¡¯

¡°¡®Good¡ªall right,¡¯ said a voice almost lost in the distance.

¡°¡®Close the door,¡¯ said La Carconte; ¡®I do not like open doors when it
thunders.¡¯

¡°¡®Particularly when there is money in the house, eh?¡¯ answered
Caderousse, double-locking the door.

20311m


¡°He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and
pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and
bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering
lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman, especially, was
hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her
countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals.

¡°¡®Why,¡¯ she inquired in a hoarse voice, ¡®did you invite him to sleep
here tonight?¡¯

¡°¡®Why?¡¯ said Caderousse with a shudder; ¡®why, that he might not have the
trouble of returning to Beaucaire.¡¯

¡°¡®Ah,¡¯ responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe;
¡®I thought it was for something else.¡¯

¡°¡®Woman, woman¡ªwhy do you have such ideas?¡¯ cried Caderousse; ¡®or, if
you have them, why don¡¯t you keep them to yourself?¡¯

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ said La Carconte, after a moment¡¯s pause, ¡®you are not a man.¡¯

¡°¡®What do you mean?¡¯ added Caderousse.

¡°¡®If you had been a man, you would not have let him go from here.¡¯

¡°¡®Woman!¡¯

¡°¡®Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire.¡¯

¡°¡®Woman!¡¯

¡°¡®The road takes a turn¡ªhe is obliged to follow it¡ªwhile alongside of
the canal there is a shorter road.¡¯

¡°¡®Woman!¡ªyou offend the good God. There¡ªlisten!¡¯

And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the
livid lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the
distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode. ¡®Mercy!¡¯
said Caderousse, crossing himself.

20312m


¡°At the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which
usually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.
Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other.

¡°¡®Who¡¯s there?¡¯ cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the
gold and notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his
two hands.

¡°¡®It is I,¡¯ shouted a voice.

¡°¡®And who are you?¡¯

¡°¡®Eh, pardieu! Joannes, the jeweller.¡¯

¡°¡®Well, and you said I offended the good God,¡¯ said La Carconte with a
horrid smile. ¡®Why, the good God sends him back again.¡¯ Caderousse sank
pale and breathless into his chair.

¡°La Carconte, on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards
the door, opened it, saying, as she did so:

¡°¡®Come in, dear M. Joannes.¡¯

¡°¡®Ma foi,¡¯ said the jeweller, drenched with rain, ¡®I am not destined to
return to Beaucaire tonight. The shortest follies are best, my dear
Caderousse. You offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have
returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.¡¯

¡°Caderousse stammered out something, while he wiped away the sweat that
started to his brow. La Carconte double-locked the door behind the
jeweller.¡±






Chapter 45. The Rain of Blood

As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a
scrutinizing glance¡ªbut there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it did
not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened. Caderousse¡¯s
hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La Carconte called up
her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest.

¡°¡®Well, well,¡¯ said the jeweller, ¡®you seem, my good friends, to have
had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting it
over so carefully directly I was gone.¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, no,¡¯ answered Caderousse, ¡®that was not my reason, I can assure
you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this
wealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good
fortune, and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before
our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a
dream.¡¯

¡°The jeweller smiled. ¡®Have you any other guests in your house?¡¯
inquired he.

¡°¡®Nobody but ourselves,¡¯ replied Caderousse; ¡®the fact is, we do not
lodge travellers¡ªindeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody
would think of stopping here.¡¯

¡°¡®Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.¡¯

¡°¡®Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,¡¯ said La Carconte in her
most gracious manner. ¡®Not at all, I assure you.¡¯

¡°¡®But where will you manage to stow me?¡¯

¡°¡®In the chamber overhead.¡¯

¡°¡®Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?¡¯

¡°¡®Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.¡¯

¡°Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment.

¡°The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,
by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the
slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four fresh-
laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure¡ªthe
banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into the
bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began
pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to
time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet
clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the
whole of his garments to be dried.

¡°¡®There,¡¯ said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the table,
¡®supper is ready whenever you are.¡¯

¡°¡®And you?¡¯ asked Joannes.

¡°¡®I don¡¯t want any supper,¡¯ said Caderousse.

¡°¡®We dined so very late,¡¯ hastily interposed La Carconte.

¡°¡®Then it seems I am to eat alone,¡¯ remarked the jeweller.

¡°¡®Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,¡¯ answered La
Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest
even to guests who paid for what they took.

¡°From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.

¡°¡®There, there,¡¯ said La Carconte; ¡®do you hear that? upon my word, you
did well to come back.¡¯

¡°¡®Nevertheless,¡¯ replied the jeweller, ¡®if by the time I have finished
my supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.¡¯

¡°¡®It¡¯s the mistral,¡¯ said Caderousse, ¡®and it will be sure to last till
tomorrow morning.¡¯ He sighed heavily.

¡°¡®Well,¡¯ said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, ¡®all I can
say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ chimed in La Carconte, ¡®they will have a wretched night of it.¡¯

¡°The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily
so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly
transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the unhappy
man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with
her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his
mind, or at least have greatly astonished him. Caderousse, meanwhile,
continued to pace the room in gloomy silence, sedulously avoiding the
sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his
repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it.

¡°¡®I believe the storm is over,¡¯ said he.

¡°But as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap
of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a
sudden gust of wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in
his hand.

¡°Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned
to his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering
ashes that glimmered on the hearth.

¡°¡®You must be tired,¡¯ said she to the jeweller; ¡®I have spread a pair of
white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready, and sleep well.¡¯

¡°Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in
its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that, instead
of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily
increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he
bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head
and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager
glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on
the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even
glancing at him.

¡°All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as
they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the exception
of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of
improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and
fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I
determined to obtain a few hours¡¯ sleep. Overhead I could accurately
distinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best
arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself
on his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight.

¡°Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having
no suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked
into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a
long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are
frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so
that I could not see the expression of his countenance¡ªneither should I
have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was
buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for
some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately
opposite to him.

¡°At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the
kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed
over the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband, but
as he made no sign of changing his position, she extended her hard, bony
hand, and touched him on the forehead.

20317m


¡°Caderousse shuddered. The woman¡¯s lips seemed to move, as though she
were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my senses
were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered. Confused
sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell into a
deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state I
know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,
followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across
the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed
to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered
consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled
cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more
prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually
roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I
looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must
have penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of
moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I
passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.

¡°To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
perfect silence¡ªunbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about
in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room
below, approached the fire and lit a candle.

¡°The man was Caderousse¡ªhe was pale and his shirt was all bloody. Having
obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I heard his
rapid and uneasy footsteps.

¡°A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small
shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the
diamond,¡ªseemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,
then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he
deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round
his head.

¡°After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put
there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the other
into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of linen, and
rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the night.

¡°Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself with
what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I
fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the
unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his
relief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had
committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this
purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from
the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly
fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts,
and I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the lighted
candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite
across the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I had heard
had doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully lacerated her
throat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as the mouth, the
blood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I strode past her, and
ascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented an appearance of the
wildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly
struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets, to which the
unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged across the room.
The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning against the wall,
and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large
wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in which a long table
knife was plunged up to the handle.

¡°I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine¡ªit was the second
pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I
approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my
footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them
on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though
trying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.

¡°This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I
could no longer be of service to anyone in the house, my only desire was
to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and uttering
a groan of horror.

¡°Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house
officers, and two or three gendarmes¡ªall heavily armed. They threw
themselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my
senses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped
my lips.

¡°As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to
my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then I
discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay
beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I pointed
to the spot where I had concealed myself.

¡°¡®What does he mean?¡¯ asked a gendarme.

¡°One of the officers went to the place I directed.

¡°¡®He means,¡¯ replied the man upon his return, ¡®that he got in that way;¡¯
and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through.

¡°Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and
energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while
I managed to stammer forth:

¡°¡®I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!¡¯

¡°A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my
breast.

¡°¡®Stir but a step,¡¯ said they, ¡®and you are a dead man.¡¯

¡°¡®Why should you threaten me with death,¡¯ cried I, ¡®when I have already
declared my innocence?¡¯

¡°¡®Tush, tush,¡¯ cried the men; ¡®keep your innocent stories to tell to the
judge at N?mes. Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice we
can give you is to do so unresistingly.¡¯

¡°Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered by
surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be
handcuffed and tied to a horse¡¯s tail, and thus they took me to N?mes.

¡°I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near
the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he
had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear
the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my
innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of
beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry
to be made for the Abb¨¦ Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont
du Gard on that morning.

¡°If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and there
existed no such person as the Abb¨¦ Busoni, then, indeed, I was lost past
redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance of
Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.

¡°Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I must
do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain
information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would.
Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself to what
seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the approaching
assizes; when, on the 8th of September¡ªthat is to say, precisely three
months and five days after the events which had perilled my life¡ªthe
Abb¨¦ Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see, presented
himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners
wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the
particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire.

¡°You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how
minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some
degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but,
to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular,
and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I
said.

¡°And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was
acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and
considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really
guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind,
I besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I
recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other
transaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best
feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of
calculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil
proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused.
When he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his
doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.

¡°I had speedy proofs that the excellent abb¨¦ was engaged in my behalf,
for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be
postponed to the assizes following those now being held.

¡°In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of
Caderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought back
to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of
his wife¡¯s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his
own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I
was immediately set at liberty.¡±

¡°And then it was, I presume,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°that you came to me as
the bearer of a letter from the Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡±

¡°It was, your excellency; the benevolent abb¨¦ took an evident interest
in all that concerned me.

¡°¡®Your mode of life as a smuggler,¡¯ said he to me one day, ¡®will be the
ruin of you; if you get out, don¡¯t take it up again.¡¯

¡°¡®But how,¡¯ inquired I, ¡®am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?¡¯

¡°¡®A person, whose confessor I am,¡¯ replied he, ¡®and who entertains a
high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a
confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give you
a letter of introduction to him.¡¯

¡°¡®Oh, father,¡¯ I exclaimed, ¡®you are very good.¡¯

¡°¡®But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent
my recommendation.¡¯

¡°I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself by any promise he
would dictate, but he stopped me.

¡°¡®It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,¡¯ said he; ¡®I
know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take
this,¡¯ continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to
your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me
into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever
had cause to repent having done so?¡±

¡°No,¡± replied the count; ¡°I take pleasure in saying that you have served
me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in
me.¡±

¡°I, your excellency?¡±

¡°Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son,
you have never spoken to me of either?¡±

20323m


¡°Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.
Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister, I
lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano I
found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible that
the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my advice,
my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of
Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as long as he
believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning he
threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him
with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day, leaving
the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to
weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came, and still,
with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for his return.

¡°As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air, attended
by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions. She
stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of
the three¡ªnone other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed:

¡°¡®Put her to torture and she¡¯ll soon tell us where her money is.¡¯

¡°It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Wasilio, was at Bastia,
leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside
could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two held
poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her,
smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned,
and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the
sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost
towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her
supposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught fire,
and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve
themselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta
rushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows,
but they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks;
it was Assunta calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next
morning, as soon as Wasilio¡¯s wife could muster up courage to venture
abroad, she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public
authorities, when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still
breathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open,
and the money stolen. Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano,
neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning
him.

¡°It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your
excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned
Benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister,
since she was dead.¡±

¡°And in what light did you view the occurrence?¡± inquired Monte Cristo.

¡°As a punishment for the crime I had committed,¡± answered Bertuccio.
¡°Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!¡±

¡°Truly they are,¡± murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.

¡°And now,¡± resumed Bertuccio, ¡°your excellency may, perhaps, be able to
comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first time¡ªthis
garden, the actual scene of my crime¡ªmust have given rise to reflections
of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and depression of
spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who was pleased to
express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a shudder passes
over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave
in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground was dug to
receive the corpse of his child.¡±

¡°Everything is possible,¡± said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on
which he had been sitting; ¡°even,¡± he added in an inaudible voice, ¡°even
that the procureur be not dead. The Abb¨¦ Busoni did right to send you to
me,¡± he went on in his ordinary tone, ¡°and you have done well in
relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming
any erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto,
who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace
out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?¡±

¡°No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should
shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,
I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and
believe he is dead.¡±

¡°Do not think so, Bertuccio,¡± replied the count; ¡°for the wicked are not
so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special
watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.¡±

¡°So be it,¡± responded Bertuccio, ¡°all I ask of heaven is that I may
never see him again. And now, your excellency,¡± he added, bowing his
head, ¡°you know everything¡ªyou are my judge on earth, as the Almighty is
in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?¡±

¡°My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
Abb¨¦ Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the
instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but
one point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after
rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its
mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio¡ªthat was where you became really
culpable.¡±

¡°True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I
acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in
recalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in
order to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would,
in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to
life, partly on my sister¡¯s account, and partly from that feeling of
pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and
victorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural
and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own.
And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor
brother.¡±

Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while
Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief
silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the count
said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner:

¡°In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last
we shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words I
have heard from the lips of the Abb¨¦ Busoni. For all evils there are two
remedies¡ªtime and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to walk
alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict on you,
as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful emotions,
are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like contentment, and
serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation. The
chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous
boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms
flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have a garden laid out
in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination, and
furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose leafy screen a
visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will. This to me, who
expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall,
is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no fear of ghosts,
and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the
dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single
day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind. Should your
confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found
the Abb¨¦ Busoni, send for me, if I am still on earth, and I will soothe
your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting
soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity.¡±

Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte
Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured:

¡°Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant¡¯s grave
was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this
corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping
apartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these
particulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,
I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.¡±

After making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered
his carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression
of his master¡¯s features, took his seat beside the driver without
uttering a word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.

That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, the
Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the
party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him
to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal
attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to
Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to
make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the
attentive Nubian:

¡°It is half-past eleven o¡¯clock; Hayd¨¦e will soon be here. Have the
French attendants been summoned to await her coming?¡±

Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair
Greek, which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried
entrance, that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined
their existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three
fingers of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut
his eyes, and feigned to sleep.

¡°I understand,¡± said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Ali¡¯s pantomime;
¡°you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new
mistress in her sleeping-chamber.¡±

Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.

¡°Madame will be tired tonight,¡± continued Monte Cristo, ¡°and will, no
doubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not to weary her with
questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. You will
also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of
this country.¡±

He bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge.
The gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and stopped at the
steps. The count hastily descended, presented himself at the already
opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young woman, completely
enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold. She
raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and kissed it with a
mixture of love and respect. Some few words passed between them in that
sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods converse. The young
woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness, while the count
replied with an air of gentle gravity.

Preceded by Ali, who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the
young lady, who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte
Cristo¡¯s companion in Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while the
count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour
every light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been
thought that all its inmates slept.






Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit

About two o¡¯clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of
magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a
person, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a white
waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown
trousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his
eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so
little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles
stamped on his features¡ªa person, in a word, who, although evidently
past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards
from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the
armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the
porter¡¯s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if
he were within.

While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the
garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants who
passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be somewhat
impertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than
intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,
they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and
projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the
flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull,
which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined
to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of
such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs
be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed
on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon
that depended from his button-hole.

The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the
porter¡¯s lodge, saying:

¡°Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?¡±

¡°His excellency does reside here,¡± replied the concierge; ¡°but¡ª¡ª¡± added
he, glancing an inquiring look at Ali. Ali returned a sign in the
negative.

¡°But what?¡± asked the groom.

¡°His excellency does not receive visitors today.¡±

¡°Then here is my master¡¯s card, the Baron Danglars. You will take it to
the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my
master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.¡±

¡°I never speak to his excellency,¡± replied the concierge; ¡°the valet de
chambre will carry your message.¡±

The groom returned to the carriage.

¡°Well?¡± asked Danglars.

The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated
what the concierge had said.

¡°Bless me,¡± murmured Baron Danglars, ¡°this must surely be a prince
instead of a count by their styling him ¡®excellency,¡¯ and only venturing
to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre. However, it does
not signify; he has a letter of credit on me, so I must see him when he
requires his money.¡±

Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his
coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, ¡°To the
Chamber of Deputies.¡±

Apprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind
the blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of
an excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
garden, and servants.

¡°That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,¡± said the count in a tone
of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its ivory case. ¡°How comes it
that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat, receding,
serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped head, and sharp-hooked
nose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali,¡± cried he, striking at the same
time on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. ¡°Summon Bertuccio,¡± said the
count. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment.

¡°Did your excellency desire to see me?¡± inquired he.

¡°I did,¡± replied the count. ¡°You no doubt observed the horses standing a
few minutes since at the door?¡±

¡°Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable
beauty.¡±

¡°Then how comes it,¡± said Monte Cristo with a frown, ¡°that, when I
desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in
Paris, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my stables?¡±

At the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count
spoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head.

¡°It is not your fault, my good Ali,¡± said the count in the Arabic
language, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of
showing, either in voice or face¡ª¡°it is not your fault. You do not
understand the points of English horses.¡±

The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity.

¡°Permit me to assure your excellency,¡± said Bertuccio, ¡°that the horses
you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours.¡±

Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders. ¡°It seems, sir steward,¡± said he,
¡°that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as
care to pay the price.¡±

¡°His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000
francs for his horses?¡±

¡°Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an
opportunity of doubling his capital.¡±

¡°Is your excellency really in earnest?¡± inquired the steward.

Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words
with the look of one equally surprised and displeased.

¡°I have to pay a visit this evening,¡± replied he. ¡°I desire that these
horses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my
carriage.¡±

Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door,
he paused, and then said, ¡°At what o¡¯clock does your excellency wish the
carriage and horses to be ready?¡±

¡°At five o¡¯clock,¡± replied the count.

¡°I beg your excellency¡¯s pardon,¡± interposed the steward in a
deprecating manner, ¡°for venturing to observe that it is already two
o¡¯clock.¡±

¡°I am perfectly aware of that fact,¡± answered Monte Cristo calmly. Then,
turning towards Ali, he said, ¡°Let all the horses in my stables be led
before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those she
prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying
whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served
in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to come
hither.¡±

Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.

¡°Monsieur Baptistin,¡± said the count, ¡°you have been in my service one
year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or
demerits of those about me. You suit me very well.¡±

Baptistin bowed low.

¡°It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?¡±

¡°Oh, your excellency!¡± exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.

¡°Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,¡± replied Monte
Cristo. ¡°You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here¡ªmore
than many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his
country, obtains. You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who
work ten times harder than you do for their money. Then, though yourself
a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care of your
clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you. Again, you
make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet, amounting in
the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.¡±

¡°Nay, indeed, your excellency.¡±

¡°I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your
profits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so
lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I
neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error I
readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My
commands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and I would rather be
obliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they should
be misunderstood. I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know,
and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I should
learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone
favorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my conduct,
that very instant you would quit my service. You may now retire. I never
caution my servants a second time¡ªremember that.¡±

Baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.

¡°I forgot to mention to you,¡± said the count, ¡°that I lay yearly aside a
certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am
compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in
this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those
domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my
death. You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun
to accumulate¡ªlet it continue to do so.¡±

This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding
one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.

¡°I assure your excellency,¡± said he, ¡°that at least it shall be my study
to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take M. Ali as my
model.¡±

¡°By no means,¡± replied the count in the most frigid tones; ¡°Ali has many
faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot possibly serve you
as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid servant,
but a mere slave¡ªa dog, who, should he fail in his duty towards me, I
should not discharge from my service, but kill.¡±

Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.

¡°You seem incredulous,¡± said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the
Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French.

The Nubian smiled assentingly to his master¡¯s words, then, kneeling on
one knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration
of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the
wonder and stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the
valet de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where
they conversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock
pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was
wanted one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three
Bertuccio. The steward entered.

¡°My horses,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
desired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?¡±

¡°No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.¡±

The count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage
drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning
as the property of Danglars. As he passed them he said:

¡°They are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to
purchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured
them sooner.¡±

¡°Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in
obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.¡±

¡°Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,¡±
inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.

¡°Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.
Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?¡±

¡°To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin.¡±

This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which
a flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with a
respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.

¡°I have another commission for you, M. Bertuccio,¡± said he; ¡°I am
desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandy¡ªfor instance,
between Le Havre and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range. It will
be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small
harbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at
anchor. She draws only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant
readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make
the requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you
have met with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the
advantages desired, purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette
must now, I think, be on her way to F¨¦camp, must she not?¡±

20333m


¡°Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening we
quitted Marseilles.¡±

¡°And the yacht.¡±

¡°Was ordered to remain at Martigues.¡±

¡°¡¯Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in
charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.¡±

¡°And the steamboat?¡±

¡°She is at Chalons?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.¡±

¡°Very good.¡±

¡°When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of
horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.¡±

¡°Your excellency may depend upon me.¡±

The Count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps,
and sprang into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the
banker¡¯s house.

Danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad
committee. But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his
visitor was announced. As the count¡¯s title sounded on his ear he rose,
and addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other
Chamber, he said:

¡°Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most ridiculous
circumstance has occurred, which is this,¡ªThomson & French, the Roman
bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of
Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me. I confess
this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course of my
extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it has
greatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to call on
the pretended count¡ªif he were a real count he wouldn¡¯t be so rich. But,
would you believe it, ¡®He was not receiving.¡¯ So the master of Monte
Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious
beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the house in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es
is his own property, and certainly it was very decently kept up. But,¡±
pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles, ¡°an order for
unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the
banker to whom that order is given. I am very anxious to see this man. I
suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it little knew whom
they had to deal with. ¡®They laugh best who laugh last!¡¯¡±

Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree
of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the
assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous
furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the
Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin. It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to
be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much
luxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and
Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which,
mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being
brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the
ceiling.

The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the
room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the
count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered
with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down.

20335m


¡°I have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.¡±

The count bowed.

¡°And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
and member of the Chamber of Deputies?¡±

Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron¡¯s card.

Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.

¡°You will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your
title when I first addressed you,¡± he said, ¡°but you are aware that we
are living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a
representative of the liberties of the people.¡±

¡°So much so,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°that while you call yourself baron
you are not willing to call anybody else count.¡±

¡°Upon my word, monsieur,¡± said Danglars with affected carelessness, ¡°I
attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I
was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return for
services rendered, but¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs.
de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to follow,
monsieur.¡±

¡°Why,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°not entirely so; with the servants,¡ªyou
understand.¡±

¡°I see; to your domestics you are ¡®my lord,¡¯ the journalists style you
¡®monsieur,¡¯ while your constituents call you ¡®citizen.¡¯ These are
distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government. I
understand perfectly.¡±

Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte
Cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn to
subjects more congenial.

¡°Permit me to inform you, Count,¡± said he, bowing, ¡°that I have received
a letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.¡±

¡°I am glad to hear it, baron,¡ªfor I must claim the privilege of
addressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the
bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country
where barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the
letter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that
will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for
money myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Danglars, ¡°but I confess I didn¡¯t quite comprehend its
meaning.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡±

¡°And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
order to beg for an explanation.¡±

¡°Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you
desire.¡±

¡°Why,¡± said Danglars, ¡°in the letter¡ªI believe I have it about me¡±¡ªhere
he felt in his breast-pocket¡ª¡°yes, here it is. Well, this letter gives
the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house.¡±

¡°Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?¡±

¡°Merely the term unlimited¡ªnothing else, certainly.¡±

¡°Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are Anglo-
Germans, you know.¡±

¡°Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;
but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have doubts.¡±

¡°Is it possible?¡± asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the
utmost simplicity and candor. ¡°Is it possible that Thomson & French are
not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me what you
think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some
considerable property in their hands.¡±

¡°Thomson & French are perfectly solvent,¡± replied Danglars, with an
almost mocking smile; ¡°but the word unlimited, in financial affairs, is
so extremely vague.¡±

¡°Is, in fact, unlimited,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Precisely what I was about to say,¡± cried Danglars. ¡°Now what is vague
is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ¡®when in doubt, keep out.¡¯¡±

¡°Meaning to say,¡± rejoined Monte Cristo, ¡°that however Thomson & French
may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron
Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.¡±

¡°Not at all.¡±

¡°Plainly enough; Messrs. Thomson & French set no bounds to their
engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise
man, according to his own showing.¡±

¡°Monsieur,¡± replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air,
¡°the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.¡±

¡°It seems, then, reserved for me,¡± said Monte Cristo coldly, ¡°to be the
first to do so.¡±

¡°By what right, sir?¡±

¡°By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you
have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.¡±

Once more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been
worsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat
awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo
on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a
certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus
possessed the advantage.

¡°Well, sir,¡± resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, ¡°I will endeavor
to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum
you propose to draw upon me?¡±

¡°Why, truly,¡± replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of
the ground he had gained, ¡°my reason for desiring an ¡®unlimited¡¯ credit
was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.¡±

The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So
throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and
purse-proud air:

¡°Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then
be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however
limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you
even to require a million¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I beg your pardon,¡± interposed Monte Cristo.

¡°I said a million,¡± replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.

¡°But could I do with a million?¡± retorted the count. ¡°My dear sir, if a
trifle like that could suffice me, I should never have given myself the
trouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my smiling when you
speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or
dressing-case.¡±

And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case
containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the treasury
for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer. A man like
Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction.
The effect of the present revelation was stunning; he trembled and was
on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as he gazed at Monte
Cristo dilated horribly.

¡°Come, come,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°confess honestly that you have not
perfect confidence in Thomson & French. I understand, and foreseeing
that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of
affairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that
you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein & Eskeles of
Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon
M. Lafitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare you
all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of
these two firms.¡±

The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a
trembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them
carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the
signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as
insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.

¡°Oh, sir,¡± said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the
authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the
power of gold personified in the man before him,¡ª¡°three letters of
unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon
me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.¡±

¡°Nay,¡± answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, ¡°¡¯tis not
for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be
incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?¡±

¡°Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.¡±

¡°Why,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°since we mutually understand each
other¡ªfor such I presume is the case?¡± Danglars bowed assentingly. ¡°You
are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your
mind?¡±

¡°Oh, my dear count,¡± exclaimed Danglars, ¡°I never for an instant
entertained such a feeling towards you.¡±

¡°No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we
have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and
suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable
expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Six millions!¡± gasped Danglars¡ª¡°so be it.¡±

¡°Then, if I should require more,¡± continued Monte Cristo in a careless
manner, ¡°why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present
intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that
period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However, we
shall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow. I
shall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my
steward.¡±

¡°The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o¡¯clock tomorrow
morning, my dear count,¡± replied Danglars. ¡°How would you like to have
it? in gold, silver, or notes?¡±

¡°Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,¡± said
the count, rising from his seat.

¡°I must confess to you, count,¡± said Danglars, ¡°that I have hitherto
imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of
Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?¡±

¡°It has been in the family a very long while,¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°a
sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period
of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital.
The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches
occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed by me
within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject, therefore, is
easily accounted for. However, you will be better informed as to me and
my possessions ere long.¡±

And the count, while pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them
with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor
Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay.

¡°With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,¡± continued Danglars,
¡°you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable
millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are an admirer of
paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be
bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will permit me, I
shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed entirely of
works by the ancient masters¡ªwarranted as such. Not a modern picture
among them. I cannot endure the modern school of painting.¡±

¡°You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great
fault¡ªthat they have not yet had time to become old.¡±

¡°Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen,
Bartoloni, and Canova?¡ªall foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I
think but very indifferently of our French sculptors.¡±

¡°You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your
compatriots.¡±

¡°But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each
other. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to
you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars¡ªexcuse my impatience,
my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the
family.¡±

Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor;
Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.

¡°Is the baroness at home?¡± inquired Danglars.

¡°Yes, my lord,¡± answered the man.

¡°And alone?¡±

¡°No, my lord, madame has visitors.¡±

¡°Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or
do you desire to preserve a strict incognito?¡±

¡°No, indeed,¡± replied Monte Cristo with a smile, ¡°I do not arrogate to
myself the right of so doing.¡±

¡°And who is with madame?¡ªM. Debray?¡± inquired Danglars, with an air of
indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as
he was with the secrets of the banker¡¯s domestic life.

¡°Yes, my lord,¡± replied the servant, ¡°M. Debray is with madame.¡±

Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, ¡°M.
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the
Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered
herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient
families in France. Her maiden name was De Servi¨¨res, and her first
husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.¡±

¡°I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met
M. Lucien Debray.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed?¡± said Danglars; ¡°and where was that?¡±

¡°At the house of M. de Morcerf.¡±

¡°Ah! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?¡±

¡°We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.¡±

¡°True, true,¡± cried Danglars. ¡°Let me see; have I not heard talk of some
strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his
having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used to
amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return
from Italy.¡±

¡°Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,¡± said the servant,
who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress.

¡°With your permission,¡± said Danglars, bowing, ¡°I will precede you, to
show you the way.¡±

¡°By all means,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°I follow you.¡±






Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays

The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments,
in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the
gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame
Danglars¡ªa small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered
with white Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship and
materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and
shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher; and at each side
pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of
this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion in
which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was, it had been
entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars
and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great
work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and
celebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the boudoir had then
been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars,
however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it was
understood during the time of the Directory, entertained the most
sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife¡¯s favorite
sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude,
unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more
agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and
manner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being the
presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in
proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or
displease the baroness.

Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece
of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small
work-table, was turning over the pages of an album.

Lucien had found time, preparatory to the count¡¯s arrival, to relate
many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be
remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds
of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf;
and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings,
he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in
his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently
the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored
tinge of his own heated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful
stories related of the count by de Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame
Danglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional
circumstances detailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the
album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most
gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the
count, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a formal though
graceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of
distant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.

¡°Baroness,¡± said Danglars, ¡°give me leave to present to you the Count of
Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my
correspondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the
ladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take
up his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes
to spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn
parties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember us,
as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble
entertainments.¡±

In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame
Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man
capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had selected
Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.

¡°And when did you arrive here?¡± inquired she.

¡°Yesterday morning, madame.¡±

¡°Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe? Pardon
me¡ªat least, such I have heard is your custom.¡±

¡°Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.¡±

¡°You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit. Paris
is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and f¨ºtes are over; the
Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except in Paris.
As for the Th¨¦atre Fran?ais, you know, of course, that it is nowhere.
The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the Champ-de-
Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at either of these
races, count?¡±

¡°I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good
fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of
amusement.¡±

¡°Are you fond of horses, count?¡±

¡°I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and
you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things¡ªthe
fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.¡±

¡°Nay, count,¡± said the baroness, ¡°it would have been somewhat more
gallant to have placed the ladies first.¡±

¡°You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor
to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.¡±

At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the
boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone.
Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed:

¡°I cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.¡±

¡°I assure you, madame,¡± replied the woman, ¡°it is as I have said.¡±

Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, ¡°Is
this true?¡±

¡°Is what true, madame?¡± inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.

¡°What my maid tells me.¡±

¡°But what does she tell you?¡±

¡°That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage,
he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his
knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?¡±

¡°Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,¡± said Danglars.

¡°Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what
explanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between us;
but, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,¡± continued the
baroness, ¡°among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are
two that belong exclusively to me¡ªa pair of the handsomest and most
spirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you, at least, M.
Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you my
beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised
Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the
Bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they
are gone¡ªpositively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to
the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.
Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!¡±

¡°Madame,¡± replied Danglars, ¡°the horses were not sufficiently quiet for
you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely
uneasy on your account.¡±

¡°Nonsense,¡± retorted the baroness; ¡°you could not have entertained any
alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have
had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris. But,
perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?¡±

¡°My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise you
another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and
steady.¡±

The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt,
while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture,
turned towards Monte Cristo and said,¡ª¡°Upon my word, count, I am quite
sorry not to have met you sooner. You are setting up an establishment,
of course?¡±

¡°Why, yes,¡± replied the count.

¡°I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I have
almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious
to get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young man.¡±

¡°I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,¡± said Monte
Cristo; ¡°but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriage-
horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are. Come, M.
Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your opinion upon
them.¡±

As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his wife.

¡°I could not tell you before others,¡± said he in a low tone, ¡°the reason
of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was offered me
this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent upon ruining himself as
fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any
cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000 francs by the sale of them.
Come, don¡¯t look so angry, and you shall have 4,000 francs of the money
to do what you like with, and Eug¨¦nie shall have 2,000. There, what do
you think now of the affair? Wasn¡¯t I right to part with the horses?¡±

Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt.

¡°Great heavens?¡± suddenly exclaimed Debray.

¡°What is it?¡± asked the baroness.

¡°I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we were
speaking of, harnessed to the count¡¯s carriage!¡±

¡°My dappled grays?¡± demanded the baroness, springing to the window.
¡°¡¯Tis indeed they!¡± said she.

Danglars looked absolutely stupefied.

¡°How very singular,¡± cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.

¡°I cannot believe it,¡± murmured the banker. Madame Danglars whispered a
few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying,
¡°The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.¡±

¡°I scarcely know,¡± replied the count; ¡°it was a little surprise prepared
for me by my steward, and cost me¡ªwell, somewhere about 30,000 francs.¡±

Debray conveyed the count¡¯s reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked
so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air
towards him.

¡°See,¡± said the count, ¡°how very ungrateful women are. Your kind
attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of
the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her. But
so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is
dangerous to that which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my dear
baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and
allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,
why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.¡±

Danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming
scene between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that
of Olympic Jove, predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering
clouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars¡¯
rage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take
his leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to
destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and
departed, leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.

20347m


¡°Excellent,¡± murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away. ¡°All has
gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of this family is
henceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by
which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife¡ªdelightful!
Still,¡± added he, ¡°amid all this, I have not yet been presented to
Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should have been
glad to make. But,¡± he went on with his peculiar smile, ¡°I am here in
Paris, and have plenty of time before me¡ªby and by will do for that.¡±

With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two
hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle
from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite
¡°dappled grays,¡± protesting that he could not endure the idea of making
his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his
splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman¡¯s
regrets. The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen
on them in the morning; only, by the count¡¯s orders, in the centre of
each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened
a large diamond.

To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the
whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.

During the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied
by Ali. The following day, about three o¡¯clock, a single blow struck on
the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.

¡°Ali,¡± observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, ¡°you have
frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in
throwing the lasso, have you not?¡±

Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the
affirmative.

¡°I thought I did not mistake. With your lasso you could stop an ox?¡±

Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.

¡°Or a tiger?¡±

Ali bowed his head in token of assent.

¡°A lion even?¡±

Ali sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso,
then of a strangled lion.

¡°I understand,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°you wish to tell me you have hunted
the lion?¡±

Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both
chased and captured many lions.

¡°But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing
forwards with ungovernable fury?¡±

The Nubian smiled.

¡°It is well,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°Then listen to me. Ere long a carriage
will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me
with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must manage to
stop those horses before my door.¡±

Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement
immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line
he had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him
gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased and
gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating
himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo re-
entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.

Still, as five o¡¯clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and
uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in a
room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless
steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of
approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the
regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque
proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his
favorite occupation.

Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and
almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild,
ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to
restrain their furious speed.

In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight
clasped in each other¡¯s arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them even
of the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as it
flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,
and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.

Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by
the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from
his box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,
and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain,
sunk beside his companion.

All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital.
The brief space had, however, been sufficient for a man, followed by a
number of servants, to rush from the house before which the accident had
occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of the carriage, to take
from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand,
while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy, who had
lost consciousness. Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon, and
deposited them on a sofa.

¡°Compose yourself, madame,¡± said he; ¡°all danger is over.¡± The woman
looked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive than
any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still
continued insensible. ¡°I understand the nature of your alarms, madame,¡±
said the count, carefully examining the child, ¡°but I assure you there
is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not
received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of
terror, and will soon pass.¡±

¡°Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See how
deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your
mother¡ªopen your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity
send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for
the recovery of my boy.¡±

With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to
the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a
casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass
incrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which
he let fall a single drop on the child¡¯s lips. Scarcely had it reached
them, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and
eagerly gazed around him. At this, the delight of the mother was almost
frantic.

¡°Where am I?¡± exclaimed she; ¡°and to whom am I indebted for so happy a
termination to my late dreadful alarm?¡±

¡°Madame,¡± answered the count, ¡°you are under the roof of one who esteems
himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further
continuance of your sufferings.¡±

¡°My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,¡± pursued the lady.
¡°All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars¡¯ beautiful horses,
and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the
high praise given to them.¡±

¡°Is it possible,¡± exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,
¡°that these horses belong to the baroness?¡±

¡°They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame
Danglars?¡±

20351m


¡°I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that
threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the
unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have
incurred. I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the
baroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them
back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them
from my hands.¡±

¡°You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine
has talked to me so much?¡±

¡°You have rightly guessed, madame,¡± replied the count.

¡°And I am Madame H¨¦lo?se de Villefort.¡±

The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first
time.

¡°How grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness; how
thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence
of his wife and child! Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of
your intrepid servant, this dear child and myself must both have
perished.¡±

¡°Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.¡±

¡°I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your
man.¡±

¡°I beseech you, madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo ¡°not to spoil Ali, either
by too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to acquire the habit
of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.
Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty
to me.¡±

¡°Nay,¡± interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style
adopted by the count made a deep impression, ¡°nay, but consider that to
preserve my life he has risked his own.¡±

¡°His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my
having myself saved him from death.¡±

Madame de Villefort made no further reply; her mind was utterly absorbed
in the contemplation of the person who, from the first instant she saw
him, had made so powerful an impression on her.

During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo
scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in
her arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments. The child was
small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A mass of straight black hair,
defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting
forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to
eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for
every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips, which had
not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the deep
and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child¡¯s face,
belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young. His
first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling
arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from whence the
count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking permission of
anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child
unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks out
of all the bottles.

¡°Touch nothing, my little friend,¡± cried the count eagerly; ¡°some of
those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.¡±

Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son¡¯s arm, drew
him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost
upon the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de
Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child
still closer towards her, she said:

¡°Edward, dearest, do you see that good man? He has shown very great
courage and resolution, for he exposed his own life to stop the horses
that were running away with us, and would certainly have dashed the
carriage to pieces. Thank him, then, my child, in your very best manner;
for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor I would have been alive
to speak our thanks.¡±

The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful
manner, saying, ¡°He¡¯s too ugly.¡±

20353m


The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation
very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.

¡°This lady,¡± said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language, ¡°is
desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but
the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.¡±

Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed
without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils
showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been
wounded to the heart.

¡°Will you permit me to inquire,¡± said Madame de Villefort, as she arose
to take her leave, ¡°whether you usually reside here?¡±

¡°No, I do not,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°it is a small place I have
purchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue des Champs-
¨¦lys¨¦es; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright, and are,
no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your wishes, I have
desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages,
and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,¡± continued he, addressing the
boy with a smiling air, ¡°will have the honor of driving you home, while
your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your
calash. As soon as that important business is concluded, I will have a
pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars.¡±

¡°I dare not return with those dreadful horses,¡± said Madame de
Villefort.

¡°You will see,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°that they will be as different as
possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle and docile as
lambs.¡±

Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who
had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed
their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar,
and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths. Then,
commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their
bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd
collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified
animals to the count¡¯s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted
the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the
ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was
actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he
could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained
from the celebrated ¡°dappled grays,¡± now changed into a couple of dull,
sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with so
much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours
returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honor¨¦.

20355m


Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:¡ª

¡°Dear Hermine,¡ªI have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent
danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were
talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see today. I
remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic
and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to admit that
your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of
his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted forward
like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there
seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being
dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress,
when a strange-looking man,¡ªan Arab, a negro, or a Nubian, at least a
black of some nation or other¡ªat a signal from the count, whose domestic
he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even at the
risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must have had
a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and took us into
his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life. He sent us
home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you tomorrow. You
will find your horses in bad condition, from the results of this
accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at
having been conquered by man. The count, however, has commissioned me to
assure you that two or three days¡¯ rest, with plenty of barley for their
sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that is as
terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday.

20356m


Adieu! I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but,
after all, I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses,
more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the
Count of Monte Cristo,¡ªand certainly that illustrious personage, apart
from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed
to me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one, delight in
solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to the
Bois behind your horses.

Edward endured the accident with miraculous courage¡ªhe did not utter a
single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from his
eyes after it was over. I doubt not you will consider these praises the
result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in that
delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends many affectionate remembrances
to your dear Eug¨¦nie. I embrace you with all my heart.

H¨¦lo?se de Villefort.

P.S.¡ªDo pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte
Cristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made M.
de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be
returned.

That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert
related it to his mother; Chateau-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey
Club, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;
even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of
the count¡¯s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
aristocracy.

Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their
names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of
renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all
the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.

As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of H¨¦lo?se to the
letter,¡ªdonned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered
the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and
drove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es.

Chapter 48. Ideology

If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the
ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the
significance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well
at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,
whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked
upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced a
political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly
supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de
Villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his
eminence like a Harlay or a Mol¨¦. His drawing-room, under the
regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first
marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris
salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of
rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A freezing politeness, a
strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for
theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,¡ªthese were the
elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.

30023m


M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
His relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with
dignity and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so
many things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but
sometimes consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been
possible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who
rebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.
This fortress was his post as king¡¯s attorney, all the advantages of
which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have
resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by
opposition.

Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife
visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the
weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as
an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of
professed superiority¡ªin fact, the application of the axiom, Pretend to
think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you, an axiom a
hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the Greeks,
¡°Know thyself,¡± a knowledge for which, in our days, we have substituted
the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others.

To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies,
he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the one
nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He had a haughty
bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing
and inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had built and cemented
the pedestal upon which his fortune was based.

M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the
least wearisome man in France. He gave a ball every year, at which he
appeared for a quarter of an hour only,¡ªthat is to say, five-and-forty
minutes less than the king is visible at his balls. He was never seen at
the theatres, at concerts, or in any place of public resort.
Occasionally, but seldom, he played at whist, and then care was taken to
select partners worthy of him¡ªsometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes
archbishops, or sometimes a prince, or a president, or some dowager
duchess.

Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of
Monte Cristo¡¯s door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at
the moment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a
map the route from St. Petersburg to China.

The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would
have employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or
rather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as
assistant attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had made
no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being
slender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his
deep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes
seemed to be an integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in
black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance
was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost
imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of
blood traced with a delicate brush.

Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible
curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who, distrustful
by habit, and especially incredulous as to social prodigies, was much
more despised to look upon ¡°the noble stranger,¡± as Monte Cristo was
already called, as an adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped
criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the
Thousand and One Nights.

¡°Sir,¡± said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in
their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest
themselves in society, ¡°sir, the signal service which you yesterday
rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my
thanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express
to you my overwhelming gratitude.¡±

And as he said this, the ¡°eye severe¡± of the magistrate had lost nothing
of its habitual arrogance. He spoke in a voice of the procureur-general,
with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his
flatterers to say (as we have before observed) that he was the living
statue of the law.

¡°Monsieur,¡± replied the count, with a chilling air, ¡°I am very happy to
have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that
the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune
which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with
a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for
I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which
he now bestows on me,¡ªa favor which, however estimable, is unequal to
the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.¡±

Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected,
started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor
he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that
moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte
Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.

He glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the
conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic. He saw
the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered, and said:

¡°You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is a rich study for you, who,
as I learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.¡±

¡°Yes, sir,¡± replied the count; ¡°I have sought to make of the human race,
taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals¡ªa
physiological study. I have believed it was much easier to descend from
the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole. It is an
algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown
quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg
of you.¡±

Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take
the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back
into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.
Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back
towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which
furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,¡ªa conversation which
assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf, a
turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation.

¡°Ah, you philosophize,¡± replied Villefort, after a moment¡¯s silence,
during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he
took breath; ¡°well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do,
I should seek a more amusing occupation.¡±

¡°Why, in truth, sir,¡± was Monte Cristo¡¯s reply, ¡°man is but an ugly
caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you
said, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now, really, let me ask,
sir, have you?¡ªdo you believe you have anything to do? or to speak in
plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called
anything?¡±

Villefort¡¯s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly
made by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate
had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly,
it was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur exerted
himself to reply.

¡°Sir,¡± he responded, ¡°you are a stranger, and I believe you say yourself
that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental countries, so you
are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in barbarous countries,
takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.¡±

¡°Oh, yes¡ªyes, I do, sir; it is the pede claudo of the ancients. I know
all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I
have occupied myself¡ªit is with the criminal procedure of all nations
that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is
the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation, that I
have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.¡±

¡°If this law were adopted, sir,¡± said the procureur, ¡°it would greatly
simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as
you just observed) have much to do.¡±

¡°It may, perhaps, come to this in time,¡± observed Monte Cristo; ¡°you
know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and
simplicity is always perfection.¡±

¡°In the meanwhile,¡± continued the magistrate, ¡°our codes are in full
force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic
customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you
will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs
tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong
power of brain to retain it.¡±

¡°I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect
to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code, but as
regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish, Japanese, Hindu
laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was right,
when I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is
relative, sir)¡ªthat relatively to what I have done, you have very little
to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a great
deal to learn.¡±

¡°But with what motive have you learned all this?¡± inquired Villefort, in
astonishment.

Monte Cristo smiled.

¡°Really, sir,¡± he observed, ¡°I see that in spite of the reputation which
you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from the
material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending with
man¡ªthat is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which it is
possible for human understanding to embrace.¡±

¡°Pray, sir, explain yourself,¡± said Villefort, more and more astonished,
¡°I really do¡ªnot¡ªunderstand you¡ªperfectly.¡±

¡°I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of
nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the
sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize
before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions
have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has
put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a
mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill¡ªI say that they escape
your narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus that human
weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs. Tobias took
the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man. The
nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror
similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal
their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was
compelled to say, ¡®I am the angel of the Lord¡¯; and the other, ¡®I am the
hammer of God,¡¯ in order that the divine essence in both might be
revealed.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he
was speaking to a mystic or a madman, ¡°you consider yourself as one of
those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?¡±

¡°And why not?¡± said Monte Cristo coldly.

¡°Your pardon, sir,¡± replied Villefort, quite astounded, ¡°but you will
excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I
should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far
surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not usual
with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like
yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune¡ªat least, so it is
said¡ªand I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely repeat;¡ªit
is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste
their time in speculations on the state of society, in philosophical
reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited
from the goods of this world.¡±

¡°Really, sir,¡± retorted the count, ¡°have you attained the eminent
situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without
having met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which must
have acquired so much finesse and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the
kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a magistrate be not
merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder
of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a
touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or
less of alloy?¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said Villefort, ¡°upon my word, you overcome me. I really never
heard a person speak as you do.¡±

¡°Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general
conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper
spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.¡±

¡°And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and
invisible beings mingle amongst us?¡±

¡°Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without
which you could not for a moment exist?¡±

¡°Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?¡±

¡°Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a
material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them,
and they reply to you.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Villefort, smiling, ¡°I confess I should like to be warned
when one of these beings is in contact with me.¡±

¡°You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just
now, and I now again warn you.¡±

¡°Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?¡±

¡°Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in
a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited either by
mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of
language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an
Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard¡ªI am
a cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what
country will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You
believe me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility
and purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab;
Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Hayd¨¦e, my slave, thinks me
a Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country,
asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man as my
brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the
obstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only
two adversaries¡ªI will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I
subdue even them,¡ªthey are time and distance. There is a third, and the
most terrible¡ªthat is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can
stop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which I
aim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms. What men
call the chances of fate¡ªnamely, ruin, change, circumstances¡ªI have
fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will
not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and
therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from
the mouths of kings¡ªfor kings have need, and other persons have fear of
you. For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as
incongruously organized as ours, ¡®Perhaps some day I shall have to do
with the king¡¯s attorney¡¯?¡±

¡°But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant of
France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.¡±

¡°I know it sir,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°but when I visit a country I
begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom
I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as,
perhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that
the king¡¯s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,
would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.¡±

¡°That is to say,¡± replied Villefort with hesitation, ¡°that human nature
being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.¡±

¡°Faults or crimes,¡± responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.

¡°And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your
brothers¡ªfor you have said so,¡± observed Villefort in a tone that
faltered somewhat¡ª¡°you alone are perfect.¡±

¡°No, not perfect,¡± was the count¡¯s reply; ¡°only impenetrable, that¡¯s
all. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is
displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you
by my second-sight.¡±

¡°No, no,¡ªby no means,¡± said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to
abandon his ground. ¡°No; by your brilliant and almost sublime
conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer
talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians in their
collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies, occasionally
say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing
in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to you, rude as
it may seem, ¡®My brother, you sacrifice greatly to pride; you may be
above others, but above you there is God.¡¯¡±

30029m


¡°Above us all, sir,¡± was Monte Cristo¡¯s response, in a tone and with an
emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered. ¡°I have my
pride for men¡ªserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass
without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside that pride before God,
who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.¡±

¡°Then, count, I admire you,¡± said Villefort, who, for the first time in
this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown
personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. ¡°Yes, and I say
to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious, or
impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same
thing¡ªthen be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of
predominance. Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.¡±

¡°I have, sir.¡±

¡°And what may it be?¡±

¡°I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by
Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed
me all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to
me, ¡®Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?¡¯ I
reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then
I replied, ¡®Listen,¡ªI have always heard of Providence, and yet I have
never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make me
believe that he exists. I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that
the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to
recompense and punish.¡¯ Satan bowed his head, and groaned. ¡®You
mistake,¡¯ he said, ¡®Providence does exist, only you have never seen him,
because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have seen
nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and
moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of the
agents of that Providence.¡¯ The bargain was concluded. I may sacrifice
my soul, but what matters it?¡± added Monte Cristo. ¡°If the thing were to
do again, I would again do it.¡±

Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.

¡°Count,¡± he inquired, ¡°have you any relations?¡±

¡°No, sir, I am alone in the world.¡±

¡°So much the worse.¡±

¡°Why?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down
your pride. You say you fear nothing but death?¡±

¡°I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could
check the execution of my plans.¡±

¡°And old age?¡±

¡°My end will be achieved before I grow old.¡±

¡°And madness?¡±

¡°I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,¡ªnon bis in idem. It is
an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full
application.¡±

30031m


¡°Sir,¡± continued Villefort, ¡°there is something to fear besides death,
old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy¡ªthat lightning-
stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which brings
everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you are
yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are but
an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is
called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than
apoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation at
my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father,
M. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French
Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,
seconded by a most powerful organization¡ªa man who has not, perhaps,
like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to
overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like
you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of
Providence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on the
lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an hour,
but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the old
Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine,
the cannon, and the dagger¡ªM. Noirtier, playing with revolutions¡ªM.
Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns,
rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was
checkmated¡ªM. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning poor M.
Noirtier, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest
creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb
and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be
given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its
decay.¡±

¡°Alas, sir,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°this spectacle is neither strange to my
eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like my
fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead
matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,
although present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,
St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison
you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father¡¯s sufferings
may effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you, sir,
since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this
terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to
your family.¡±

¡°It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a
compensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to
the tomb, are two children just entering into life¡ªValentine, the
daughter by my first wife¡ªMademoiselle Ren¨¦e de Saint-M¨¦ran¡ªand Edward,
the boy whose life you have this day saved.¡±

¡°And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?¡± inquired Monte
Cristo.

¡°My deduction is,¡± replied Villefort, ¡°that my father, led away by his
passions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked
by the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but one
person, has visited this justice on him alone.¡±

Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul
a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.

¡°Adieu, sir,¡± said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; ¡°I leave
you, bearing a remembrance of you¡ªa remembrance of esteem, which I hope
will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I am not a
man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have made an
eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.¡±

The count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door
of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two
footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with every
mark of attention. When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a profound
sigh, and said:

¡°Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.¡±

Then sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:

¡°I am going to madame¡¯s chamber¡ªhave the carriage ready at one o¡¯clock.¡±






Chapter 49. Hayd¨¦e

It will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the
Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than
Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.

The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming
visits¡ªthe bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the
almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged, illumined his
whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness, as,
immediately after Villefort¡¯s departure, his thoughts flew back to the
cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a brief respite from
the fierce and stormy passions of his mind. Even Ali, who had hastened
to obey the Count¡¯s summons, went forth from his master¡¯s presence in
charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on
features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as though dreading to put
to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron¡¯s meditations,
whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the
door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound should dissipate his
master¡¯s happy reverie.

It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the
apartments of Hayd¨¦e, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at
once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual
succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive
full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures
demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent
sensations.

The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly
unconnected with those of the count. The rooms had been fitted up in
strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the
richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk
of the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber
luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions,
that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such
as sought repose.

Hayd¨¦e had three French maids, and one who was a Greek. The first three
remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons
of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave,
who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress¡¯s wishes
to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most
peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Hayd¨¦e with all the
deference they would observe to a queen.

The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the
farther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular, and
lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.
Hayd¨¦e was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin
spotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely
moulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the
other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich
narghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its
passage through perfumed water. Her attitude, though perfectly natural
for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too full of
coquettish straining after effect.

Her dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair of
white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet so
exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have
been taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their
movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little
slippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and
pearls. She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves,
trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice,
which, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of
the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three
magnificent diamond clasps. The junction of the bodice and drawers was
entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves, whose brilliant
hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes
of Parisian belles.

Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored silk,
embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled its
glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the
blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue.

The extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness
that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and
purely Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely
formed nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race
and country.

And, to complete the whole, Hayd¨¦e was in the very springtide and
fulness of youthful charms¡ªshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen
or twenty summers.

Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether
it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. Hayd¨¦e¡¯s
only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the
tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the
framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the
graceful tableau presented by the young girl¡¯s picturesque attitude and
appearance.

As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that
held the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said, with a
smile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken by the
women of Athens and Sparta:

¡°Why demand permission ere you enter? Are you no longer my master, or
have I ceased to be your slave?¡±

Monte Cristo returned her smile.

¡°Hayd¨¦e,¡± said he, ¡°you well know.¡±

¡°Why do you address me so coldly¡ªso distantly?¡± asked the young Greek.
¡°Have I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so, punish me as you will;
but do not¡ªdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and
constrained.¡±

¡°Hayd¨¦e,¡± replied the count, ¡°you know that you are now in France, and
are free.¡±

¡°Free to do what?¡± asked the young girl.

¡°Free to leave me.¡±

¡°Leave you? Why should I leave you?¡±

¡°That is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in society¡ªto
visit and be visited.¡±

¡°I don¡¯t wish to see anybody but you.¡±

¡°And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so
unjust¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I have never seen anyone I preferred to you, and I have never loved
anyone but you and my father.¡±

¡°My poor child,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°that is merely because your
father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you.¡±

¡°I don¡¯t want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was his
¡®joy¡¯¡ªyou style me your ¡®love,¡¯¡ªand both of you have called me ¡®my
child.¡¯¡±

¡°Do you remember your father, Hayd¨¦e?¡±

The young Greek smiled.

¡°He is here, and here,¡± said she, touching her eyes and her heart.

¡°And where am I?¡± inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.

¡°You?¡± cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, ¡°you are
everywhere!¡± Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in
his, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child of
nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek.

¡°You now understand, Hayd¨¦e,¡± said the count, ¡°that from this moment you
are absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are at
liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it may
suit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of
your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem
most agreeable to you. A carriage waits your orders, and Ali and Myrtho
will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go. There is but one
favor I would entreat of you.¡±

¡°Speak.¡±

¡°Guard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the past;
nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your
illustrious father or ill-fated mother.¡±

¡°I have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one.¡±

¡°It is possible, Hayd¨¦e, that so perfect a seclusion, though conformable
with the habits and customs of the East, may not be practicable in
Paris. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our manner of living in
these northern climes as you did to those of Rome, Florence, Milan, and
Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days, whether you remain
here or return to the East.¡±

The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said
with touching earnestness, ¡°Whether we return to the East, you mean to
say, my lord, do you not?¡±

¡°My child,¡± returned Monte Cristo ¡°you know full well that whenever we
part, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the
flower¡ªthe flower falls from the tree.¡±

¡°My lord,¡± replied Hayd¨¦e, ¡°I never will leave you, for I am sure I
could not exist without you.¡±

¡°My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still
young.¡±

¡°My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years
old, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.¡±

¡°Then tell me, Hayd¨¦e, do you believe you shall be able to accustom
yourself to our present mode of life?¡±

¡°Shall I see you?¡±

¡°Every day.¡±

¡°Then what do you fear, my lord?¡±

¡°You might find it dull.¡±

¡°No, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your
coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have
enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty
pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering
mountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great
passions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, ennui can
find no place.¡±

¡°You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Hayd¨¦e, and your charming and
poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who
claim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see that
your youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial
solitude; and of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father,
I love you as a child.¡±

¡°You are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different from
the love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If you
were to die, I should die too.¡±

The count, with a smile of profound tenderness, extended his hand, and
she carried it to her lips.

Monte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with
Morrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of
Pindar, ¡°Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who,
after having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call
it his own.¡± The carriage was prepared according to orders, and stepping
lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.






Chapter 50. The Morrel Family

In a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The
house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small
beds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate
the count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye had
become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not
recognize the count.

The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to avoid
a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,¡ªan ornament that had
excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the place
the appellation of The Little Versailles. It is needless to add that
there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with kitchens
and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and attics.
The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop, two
pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had been
purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make of it
a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the garden,
and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them
upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So that for a
trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut out from
observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg
St. Germain.

The breakfast-room was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the
furnishings were of blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and green
damask. There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a music-
room for Julie, who never played. The whole of the second story was set
apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister¡¯s
apartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room,
where he received his friends. He was superintending the grooming of his
horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the
count¡¯s carriage stopped at the gate.

Cocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired
whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel
would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.

¡°The Count of Monte Cristo?¡± cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and
hastening to the carriage; ¡°I should think we would see him. Ah, a
thousand thanks, count, for not having forgotten your promise.¡±

And the young officer shook the count¡¯s hand so warmly, that Monte
Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw
that he had been expected with impatience, and was received with
pleasure.

¡°Come, come,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°I will serve as your guide; such a man
as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the
garden plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers, la
Presse and les D¨¦bats, within six steps of her; for wherever you see
Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four yards and
you will find M. Emmanuel, and ¡®reciprocally,¡¯ as they say at the
Polytechnic School.¡±

At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five-and-twenty,
dressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged in plucking the dead
leaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head. This was Julie, who
had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted,
Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of
a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh.

¡°Don¡¯t disturb yourself, Julie,¡± said he. ¡°The count has only been two
or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of
the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.¡±

¡°Ah, monsieur,¡± returned Julie, ¡°it is treason in my brother to bring
you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon,
Penelon!¡±

An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade
in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid of
tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of gray mingled
with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his bronzed
features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved
the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics.

¡°I think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?¡± said he.

Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master¡¯s daughter
¡°Mademoiselle Julie,¡± and had never been able to change the name to
Madame Herbault.

¡°Penelon,¡± replied Julie, ¡°go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman¡¯s
visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.¡±

Then, turning to Monte Cristo,¡ª¡°I hope you will permit me to leave you
for a few minutes,¡± continued she; and without awaiting any reply,
disappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a
lateral alley.

30041m


¡°I am sorry to see,¡± observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, ¡°that I cause no
small disturbance in your house.¡±

¡°Look there,¡± said Maximilian, laughing; ¡°there is her husband changing
his jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue
Meslay.¡±

¡°Your family appears to be a very happy one,¡± said the count, as if
speaking to himself.

¡°Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them
happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each
other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves
as rich as Rothschild.¡±

¡°Five-and-twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,¡± replied
Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to
Maximilian¡¯s heart like the voice of a father; ¡°but they will not be
content with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?¡±

¡°He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my
poor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were
divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children. Her
husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble
probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to
possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he had amassed
250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object. Oh, I assure
you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures,
destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and
through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their
paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous
people would have effected in two or three. Marseilles resounded with
their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife,
who had just finished making up the accounts.

¡°¡®Julie,¡¯ said he to her, ¡®Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of
a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the
limits of our gains. Can you content yourself with the small fortune
which we shall possess for the future? Listen to me. Our house transacts
business to the amount of a million a year, from which we derive an
income of 40,000 francs. We can dispose of the business, if we please,
in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he
offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite with his own,
for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had better do.¡¯

¡°¡®Emmanuel,¡¯ returned my sister, ¡®the house of Morrel can only be
carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our
father¡¯s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?¡¯

¡°¡®I thought so,¡¯ replied Emmanuel; ¡®but I wished to have your advice.¡¯

¡°¡®This is my counsel:¡ªOur accounts are made up and our bills paid; all
we have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.¡¯

¡°This was done instantly. It was three o¡¯clock; at a quarter past, a
merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of
15,000 francs.

¡°¡®Monsieur,¡¯ said Emmanuel, ¡®have the goodness to address yourself to M.
Delaunay. We have quitted business.¡¯

¡°¡®How long?¡¯ inquired the astonished merchant.

30043m


¡°¡®A quarter of an hour,¡¯ was the reply.

¡°And this is the reason, monsieur,¡± continued Maximilian, ¡°of my sister
and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year.¡±

Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count¡¯s
heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and
coat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the
rank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little
garden, he returned to the house.

A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the air
with their perfume, stood in the salon. Julie, suitably dressed, and her
hair arranged (she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes),
received the count on his entrance. The songs of the birds were heard in
an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed
an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains. Everything in this
charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the
mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.

The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he
entered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that
he was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the
first salutations had been exchanged. The silence became almost painful
when, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie:

¡°Madame,¡± said he at length, ¡°I pray you to excuse my emotion, which
must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here;
but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of
looking at yourself and your husband.¡±

¡°We are very happy, monsieur,¡± replied Julie; ¡°but we have also known
unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than
ourselves.¡±

The count¡¯s features displayed an expression of the most intense
curiosity.

¡°Oh, all this is a family history, as Chateau-Renaud told you the other
day,¡± observed Maximilian. ¡°This humble picture would have but little
interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the
misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have
experienced bitter sorrows.¡±

¡°And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all
who are in affliction?¡± said Monte Cristo inquiringly.

¡°Yes, count,¡± returned Julie, ¡°we may indeed say he has, for he has done
for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his angels.¡±

The count¡¯s cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an
excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth.

¡°Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every wish,¡±
said Emmanuel, ¡°know not what is the real happiness of life, just as
those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few
frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather.¡±

Monte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness
of his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the
apartment with a slow step.

¡°Our magnificence makes you smile, count,¡± said Maximilian, who had
followed him with his eyes.

¡°No, no,¡± returned Monte Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on his
heart to still its throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a
crystal cover, beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet
cushion. ¡°I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse,
with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other.¡±

¡°Count,¡± replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, ¡°those are our most
precious family treasures.¡±

¡°The stone seems very brilliant,¡± answered the count.

¡°Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been
estimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in
this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now.¡±

¡°This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,
madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo bowing. ¡°Pardon me, I had no intention of
committing an indiscretion.¡±

¡°Indiscretion,¡ªoh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for
expatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action
this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh, would
we could relate it everywhere, and to everyone, so that the emotion of
our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence.¡±

¡°Ah, really,¡± said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.

¡°Monsieur,¡± returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and
respectfully kissing the silken purse, ¡°this has touched the hand of a
man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from
shame and disgrace,¡ªa man by whose matchless benevolence we poor
children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear everyone
envying our happy lot. This letter¡± (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a
letter from the purse and gave it to the count)¡ª¡°this letter was written
by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution, and this
diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry.¡±

Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable
feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our readers know) to
Julie, and signed ¡°Sinbad the Sailor.¡±

¡°Unknown you say, is the man who rendered you this service¡ªunknown to
you?¡±

¡°Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,¡± continued
Maximilian. ¡°We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor,
but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot
comprehend¡ªwe have been guided by an invisible hand,¡ªa hand as powerful
as that of an enchanter.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± cried Julie, ¡°I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that
hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago,
Penelon was at Trieste¡ªPenelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the
garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener¡ªPenelon, when
he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point
of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who
called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this
letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but
he did not venture to address him.¡±

¡°An Englishman,¡± said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention
with which Julie looked at him. ¡°An Englishman you say?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied Maximilian, ¡°an Englishman, who represented himself as
the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It was
this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf¡¯s,
that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That happened, as I
told you, in 1829. For God¡¯s sake, tell me, did you know this
Englishman?¡±

¡°But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have
constantly denied having rendered you this service?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who,
grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself
had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?¡±

¡°Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.¡±

¡°What was his name?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°He gave no other name,¡± answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count,
¡°than that at the end of his letter¡ª¡®Sinbad the Sailor.¡¯¡±

¡°Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.¡±

Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:

¡°Tell me,¡± continued he, ¡°was he not about my height, perhaps a little
taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat
closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?¡±

¡°Oh, do you then know him?¡± cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.

¡°No,¡± returned Monte Cristo ¡°I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who
was constantly doing actions of this kind.¡±

¡°Without revealing himself?¡±

¡°He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of
gratitude.¡±

¡°Oh, Heaven,¡± exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, ¡°in what did he
believe, then?¡±

30047m


¡°He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,¡± said Monte
Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie¡¯s voice; ¡°but,
perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.¡±

¡°And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?¡± inquired Emmanuel.

¡°Oh, if you do know him,¡± cried Julie, ¡°can you tell us where he
is¡ªwhere we can find him? Maximilian¡ªEmmanuel¡ªif we do but discover him,
he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!¡±

Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily
up and down the room.

¡°In the name of Heaven,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°if you know anything of him,
tell us what it is.¡±

¡°Alas,¡± cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, ¡°if Lord
Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him
again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on
the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he
will never return.¡±

¡°Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,¡± said Julie, much affected; and the
young lady¡¯s eyes swam with tears.

¡°Madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two
liquid pearls that trickled down Julie¡¯s cheeks, ¡°had Lord Wilmore seen
what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed
would reconcile him to mankind;¡± and he held out his hand to Julie, who
gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count.

¡°But,¡± continued she, ¡°Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must
have known someone, can we not¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Oh, it is useless to inquire,¡± returned the count; ¡°perhaps, after all,
he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no secrets
from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.¡±

¡°And he told you nothing?¡±

¡°Not a word.¡±

¡°Nothing that would lead you to suppose?¡±

¡°Nothing.¡±

¡°And yet you spoke of him at once.¡±

¡°Ah, in such a case one supposes¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Sister, sister,¡± said Maximilian, coming to the count¡¯s aid, ¡°monsieur
is quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us,
¡®It was no Englishman that thus saved us.¡¯¡±

Monte Cristo started. ¡°What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?¡± said
he eagerly.

¡°My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed¡ªhe
believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh, it
was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself
believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father¡¯s faith.
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend¡ªa
friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach
of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light,
this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became a
conviction, and his last words were, ¡®Maximilian, it was Edmond
Dant¨¨s!¡¯¡±

At these words the count¡¯s paleness, which had for some time been
increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watch
like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to
Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and
Maximilian,¡ª¡°Madame,¡± said he, ¡°I trust you will allow me to visit you
occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for your
welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have thus
yielded to my feelings;¡± and he hastily quitted the apartment.

¡°This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,¡± said Emmanuel.

¡°Yes,¡± answered Maximilian, ¡°but I feel sure he has an excellent heart,
and that he likes us.¡±

¡°His voice went to my heart,¡± observed Julie; ¡°and two or three times I
fancied that I had heard it before.¡±






Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe

About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honor¨¦, and in the
rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood,
where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and
magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-
spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a
solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of
delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood
upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that
dated from the time of Louis XIII.

This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and
the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they
waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their
scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the
mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to
the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted courtyard,
opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honor¨¦, and to the garden shut in by
this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of
about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other
words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The
street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate,
but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the
property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then
devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the
proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the
Faubourg Saint-Honor¨¦ itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in
the city of Paris.

In matters of speculation, however, though ¡°man proposes,¡± yet ¡°money
disposes.¡± From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost
in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high
price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his
bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to
the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that
would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest
upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself
with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a
yearly rental of 500 francs.

And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden
had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to
eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers
and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic
enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a
height of six feet. True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but
that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the
strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left
no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that
circumstance.

Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted
kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons
had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its
being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from
the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the
ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and
had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even
the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house the
chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall,
without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and
flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as
though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one
corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a
large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered
spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of
the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of
verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces
off.

Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary
of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the
choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the
screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no
entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the
incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from
either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the
evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the
inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone
bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly
embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these
articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring
to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the
planks,¡ªthe earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which
she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her
feelings were interested in the matter.

At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to
the street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man
appeared. He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his
carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest and
glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After casting a
rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he was
unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing and
securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the
barrier.

At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume,
the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty
retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow
chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and
observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the
planks, he exclaimed:

¡°Don¡¯t be alarmed, Valentine¡ªit is I!¡±

Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she
did so:

¡°And why do you come so late today? It is almost dinner-time, and I had
to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my
too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me
about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to
get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me
wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that
at first I did not recognize you.¡±

¡°Dearest Valentine,¡± said the young man, ¡°the difference between our
respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love,
but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour
forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to
carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even
thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you
did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to
suppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my
being late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason
of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a
trade.¡±

¡°A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such
deep cause for uneasiness?¡±

¡°Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than
life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about
it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously
alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here
your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. That
would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the
fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where
no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well
create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted
the costume of my calling.¡±

¡°What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!¡±

¡°Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life
by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen
our meetings from all suspicion or danger.¡±

30053m


¡°I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you
really mean.¡±

¡°Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I
stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by the
proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucern. Think of
that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a
little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you.
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain
myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price¡ªas a thing
impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all
this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have
surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per
annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my
own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the
wall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions
of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character. I may also
enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and
unalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless,
indeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the
lips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap.¡±

A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of
Valentine, who almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though some
envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart:

¡°Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons. We should
presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led
astray by our blind confidence in each other¡¯s prudence.¡±

¡°How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear
Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,
schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you
have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to
me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I
placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other
reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since,
by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from
the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?
You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d¡¯¨¦pinay,
and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that
from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known to
change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you
wished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but
hoping that Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and
order events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties,
Valentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on
me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure
anything.¡±

¡°Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and
which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask
myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my mother-
in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I now
am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings, so
fraught with danger to both.¡±

¡°I will not admit that word,¡± returned the young man; ¡°it is at once
cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than
myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time,
Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or
elsewhere¡ªhave I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this
enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate¡ªto be close
to you without really seeing you¡ªhave I ever asked so much as to touch
the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle
to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a murmur
escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of
olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what I say is
true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.¡±

30055m


¡°It is true,¡± said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian
to press his lips to them, ¡°and you are a true and faithful friend; but
still you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian, for
you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an
opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to
bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend
but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father,
harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole
companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand
can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone,
although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his
poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a
victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only
friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I
am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity.¡±

¡°Valentine,¡± replied the young man, deeply affected, ¡°I will not say you
are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and brother-
in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no manner
resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart beats fast,
the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but I solemnly
promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and intensity of
feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render them available in
serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to return home for a
year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable and unforeseen
chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so
sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me with
selfishness, think a little what you have been to me¡ªthe beautiful but
cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future reward have
you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced?¡ªnone
whatever. What granted me?¡ªscarcely more. You tell me of M. Franz
d¡¯¨¦pinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of being
his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your
heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm
drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service; you
know full well that my existence is bound up in yours¡ªthat were I to
lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you
speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another!
Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel conscious, as you
do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred
times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars, and
said, ¡®Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living or
dead, I am yours¡ªyours only, and forever!¡¯¡±

The poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs
and tears. A rapid change took place in the young man¡¯s feelings.

¡°Dearest, dearest Valentine,¡± exclaimed he, ¡°forgive me if I have
offended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly
caused you pain.¡±

¡°No, Maximilian, I am not offended,¡± answered she, ¡°but do you not see
what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in my
father¡¯s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been
thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the
iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted,
day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for,
even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the
subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am
surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The
general remark is, ¡®Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a
character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on
their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender
age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de
Villefort.¡¯ The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from
utter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so
much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.¡±

¡°Hate you, sweet Valentine,¡± exclaimed the young man; ¡°how is it
possible for anyone to do that?¡±

¡°Alas,¡± replied the weeping girl, ¡°I am obliged to own that my mother-
in-law¡¯s aversion to me arises from a very natural source¡ªher
overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.¡±

¡°But why should it?¡±

¡°I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into
our present conversation, I will just say this much¡ªthat her extreme
dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the
fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than
doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-M¨¦ran, whose sole heiress I
am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being
so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this
wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father¡¯s love. God
knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me
a happy and affectionate home.¡±

¡°Poor Valentine!¡±

¡°I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the same
time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the
restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too,
my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established
reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him;
he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word.
Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt
to resist my father¡¯s commands it is more on your account than my own.¡±

¡°But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,¡ªwhy
picture so gloomy a future?¡±

¡°Because I judge it from the past.¡±

¡°Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is
termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not
altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such
distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in
France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with
those of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with
the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and
certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as
well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and
the memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as
that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our
country, because you were born not far from Marseilles.¡±

¡°Don¡¯t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word
brings back my mother to my recollection¡ªmy angel mother, who died too
soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her
child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I
fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were
still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would
tell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.¡±

¡°I fear, Valentine,¡± replied the lover, ¡°that were she living I should
never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been
too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me.¡±

¡°Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,¡± cried Valentine; ¡°but there
is one thing I wish to know.¡±

¡°And what is that?¡± inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine
hesitated.

¡°Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers
dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?¡±

¡°Not that I am aware of,¡± replied the young man, ¡°unless, indeed, any
ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties¡ªyour
father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine
was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other
difference between them. But why do you ask?¡±

¡°I will tell you,¡± replied the young girl, ¡°for it is but right you
should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the
Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my
grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also¡ªyou recollect M.
Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with
my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed them? While
the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of
Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but
when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else
but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all
about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at
the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that I
really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my
doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I
summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I
could.¡±

30059m


¡°Dear Valentine!¡±

¡°Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of your
name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was
so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the
utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start,
and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have
been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.¡±

¡°¡®Morrel, Morrel,¡¯ cried my father, ¡®stop a bit;¡¯ then knitting his
brows into a deep frown, he added, ¡®surely this cannot be one of the
Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from
their violent Bonapartism¡ªI mean about the year 1815.¡¯

¡°¡®Yes,¡¯ replied M. Danglars, ¡®I believe he is the son of the old
shipowner.¡¯¡±

¡°Indeed,¡± answered Maximilian; ¡°and what did your father say then,
Valentine?¡±

¡°Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don¡¯t dare to tell you.¡±

¡°Always tell me everything,¡± said Maximilian with a smile.

¡°¡®Ah,¡¯ continued my father, still frowning, ¡®their idolized emperor
treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them ¡®food for cannon,¡¯
which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see
that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with
all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish
the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an
acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it certainly
does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized
country.¡¯¡±

¡°Brutal politics, I must confess.¡± said Maximilian; ¡°but don¡¯t attach
any serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was
not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. ¡®Why,¡¯ said he, ¡®does not
the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of
improving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and
legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could
maintain, and using them to save better men?¡¯ You see, my dear, that for
picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to
choose between the language of either party. But what did M. Danglars
say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?¡±

¡°Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to
himself¡ªhalf-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and
took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation of my
grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only person
capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I suspected
that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they
always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the
smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his
mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor
he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner.¡±

¡°The name of M. Noirtier,¡± interposed Maximilian, ¡°is celebrated
throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or
may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every
Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the
Bourbons.¡±

¡°Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most
strange¡ªthe father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have been
the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics? But to
resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to question
him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at the
newspaper I had been reading. ¡®What is the matter, dear grandfather?¡¯
said I, ¡®are you pleased?¡¯ He gave me a sign in the affirmative. ¡®With
what my father said just now?¡¯ He returned a sign in the negative.
¡®Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?¡¯ Another sign in the negative.
¡®Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn¡¯t dare to say
Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor?¡¯ He
signified assent; only think of the poor old man¡¯s being so pleased to
think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been made an
officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part,
for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love him for
showing so much interest in you.¡±

¡°How singular,¡± murmured Maximilian; ¡°your father hates me, while your
grandfather, on the contrary¡ªWhat strange feelings are aroused by
politics.¡±

¡°Hush,¡± cried Valentine, suddenly; ¡°someone is coming!¡± Maximilian
leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to pull up
in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding
it.

¡°Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!¡± exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.
¡°Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the
drawing-room.¡±

¡°A visitor?¡± inquired Valentine, much agitated; ¡°who is it?¡±

¡°Some grand personage¡ªa prince I believe they said¡ªthe Count of Monte
Cristo.¡±

¡°I will come directly,¡± cried Valentine aloud.

The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on
the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine¡¯s ¡°I am coming¡± was
the customary signal of farewell.

¡°Now, then,¡± said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, ¡°I
would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of
Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort.¡±






Chapter 52. Toxicology

It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame
de Villefort¡¯s for the purpose of returning the procureur¡¯s visit, and
at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in
confusion.

Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count
was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly
to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great
personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come
to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of
gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance
remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent
speeches which made his mother say:

¡°Oh, that naughty child! But I can¡¯t be severe with him, he is really so
bright.¡±

After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.

¡°My husband dines with the chancellor,¡± replied the young lady; ¡°he has
just gone, and I am sure he¡¯ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the
pleasure of seeing you before he went.¡±

Two visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him
with all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which
politeness admits and curiosity requires.

¡°What is your sister Valentine doing?¡± inquired Madame de Villefort of
Edward; ¡°tell someone to bid her come here, that I may have the honor of
introducing her to the count.¡±

¡°You have a daughter, then, madame?¡± inquired the count; ¡°very young, I
presume?¡±

¡°The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,¡± replied the
young wife, ¡°a fine well-grown girl.¡±

¡°But melancholy,¡± interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out
of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded
perch, in order to make a plume for his hat.

Madame de Villefort merely cried, ¡°Be still, Edward!¡± She then added,
¡°This young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes
what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de
Villefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy
disposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of
her beauty. But what detains her? Go, Edward, and see.¡±

¡°Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found.¡±

¡°And where are they looking for her?¡±

¡°With grandpapa Noirtier.¡±

¡°And do you think she is not there?¡±

¡°No, no, no, no, no, she is not there,¡± replied Edward, singing his
words.

¡°And where is she, then? If you know, why don¡¯t you tell?¡±

¡°She is under the big chestnut-tree,¡± replied the spoiled brat, as he
gave, in spite of his mother¡¯s commands, live flies to the parrot, which
seemed keenly to relish such fare.

Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring, intending to direct
her waiting-maid to the spot where she would find Valentine, when the
young lady herself entered the apartment. She appeared much dejected;
and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the
traces of recent tears in her eyes.

Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to
our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful
girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that
reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother. Her
white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with
varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so
poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan.

She entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger
of whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish
awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that
redoubled the count¡¯s attention.

He rose to return the salutation.

¡°Mademoiselle de Villefort, my step-daughter,¡± said Madame de Villefort
to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards
Valentine with her hand.

¡°And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,¡± said
the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.

Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly
angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward;
but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy
complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy
and enthusiasm.

¡°But, madame,¡± replied the count, continuing the conversation, and
looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, ¡°have I not
already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I
could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as
mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light
thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.¡±

¡°I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very
fond of society, and we very seldom go out,¡± said the young lady.

¡°Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself,
madame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world
is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in
Paris but very few days. No,¡ªbut, perhaps, you will permit me to call to
mind¡ªstay!¡±

The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts.

¡°No¡ªit was somewhere¡ªaway from here¡ªit was¡ªI do not know¡ªbut it appears
that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious
f¨ºte; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the interesting boy
was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madame, were under
the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my aid, madame; do not these
circumstances appeal to your memory?¡±

¡°No, indeed,¡± replied Madame de Villefort; ¡°and yet it appears to me,
sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have
been imprinted on my memory.¡±

¡°Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,¡± said Valentine timidly.

¡°Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,¡± replied Monte Cristo;
¡°you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?¡±

¡°Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for my
lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna, Perugia,
and Rome.¡±

¡°Ah, yes¡ªtrue, mademoiselle,¡± exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple
explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. ¡°It was
at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the H?tel des Postes,
when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and her son;
I now remember having had the honor of meeting you.¡±

¡°I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the H?tel des Postes, and
the festival of which you speak,¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°but in vain
do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really do not
recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before.¡±

¡°It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,¡± observed
Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.

30065m


¡°But I remember it perfectly,¡± interposed the darling Edward.

¡°I will assist your memory, madame,¡± continued the count; ¡°the day had
been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in
consequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of
the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.¡±

¡°And I caught it, mamma, don¡¯t you remember?¡± interposed Edward, ¡°and I
pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.¡±

¡°You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while
you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you, Mademoiselle
de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed for a
considerable time with somebody?¡±

¡°Yes, in truth, yes,¡± answered the young lady, turning very red, ¡°I do
remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he
was a medical man, I think.¡±

¡°Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been
at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a
fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a
reputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame, on
different subjects; of Perugino, of Raphael, of manners, customs, of the
famous aqua Tofana, of which they had told you, I think you said, that
certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret.¡±

¡°Yes, true,¡± replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, ¡°I remember
now.¡±

¡°I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed,
madame,¡± continued the count with perfect calmness; ¡°but I perfectly
remember that, falling into the error which others had entertained
respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de
Villefort.¡±

¡°Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,¡± said Madame de
Villefort, ¡°since you had cured the sick.¡±

¡°Moli¨¨re or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was
precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself, I
am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural
sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you understand.¡±

At this moment the clock struck six.

¡°It is six o¡¯clock,¡± said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated.
¡°Valentine, will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his
dinner?¡±

Valentine rose, and saluting the count, left the apartment without
speaking.

¡°Oh, madame,¡± said the count, when Valentine had left the room, ¡°was it
on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?¡±

¡°By no means,¡± replied the young lady quickly; ¡°but this is the hour
when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his
pitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my
husband¡¯s father?¡±

¡°Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me¡ªa paralysis, I think.¡±

¡°Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone
is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering,
like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me, sir, for
talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment
when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.¡±

¡°No, madame, I did not say as much as that,¡± replied the count with a
smile; ¡°quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having
determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following
the example of King Mithridates.¡±

¡°Mithridates, rex Ponticus,¡± said the young scamp, as he tore some
beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, ¡°the individual who took
cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.¡±

¡°Edward, you naughty boy,¡± exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching the
mutilated book from the urchin¡¯s grasp, ¡°you are positively past
bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join
your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier¡¯s room.¡±

¡°The album,¡± said Edward sulkily.

¡°What do you mean?¡ªthe album!¡±

¡°I want the album.¡±

¡°How dare you tear out the drawings?¡±

¡°Oh, it amuses me.¡±

¡°Go¡ªgo at once.¡±

¡°I won¡¯t go unless you give me the album,¡± said the boy, seating himself
doggedly in an armchair, according to his habit of never giving way.

¡°Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,¡± said Madame de
Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door,
led by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.

¡°Let us see if she shuts the door after him,¡± he muttered.

Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count
appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around
the chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated
herself.

¡°Allow me to observe, madame,¡± said the count, with that kind tone he
could assume so well, ¡°you are really very severe with that dear clever
child.¡±

¡°Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,¡± replied Madame de
Villefort, with all a mother¡¯s real firmness.

¡°It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he
referred to King Mithridates,¡± continued the count, ¡°and you interrupted
him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected
him, for your son is really advanced for his years.¡±

¡°The fact is, count,¡± answered the mother, agreeably flattered, ¡°he has
great aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one
fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment to
what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these
precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?¡±

¡°I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I
might not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna¡ªthat is to
say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must
have lost my life.¡±

¡°And your precautions were successful?¡±

¡°Completely so.¡±

¡°Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this
sort.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡± said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well
counterfeited; ¡°I really did not remember.¡±

¡°I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,
on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that the
cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude
as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South.¡±

¡°And that is the case,¡± observed Monte Cristo. ¡°I have seen Russians
devour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances which
would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.¡±

¡°And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than
in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would
habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this
progressive absorption of poison?¡±

¡°Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he
should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not
been accustomed.¡±

¡°Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for
instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?¡±

¡°Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be
made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,
brucine¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?¡± inquired
Madame de Villefort.

¡°Precisely, madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°but I perceive I have not
much to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such
learning is very rare among ladies.¡±

¡°Oh, I am aware of that,¡± said Madame de Villefort; ¡°but I have a
passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like
poetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but go
on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.¡±

30069m


¡°Well,¡± replied Monte Cristo ¡°suppose, then, that this poison was
brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two
milligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days you
would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days, increasing
another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred centigrammes;
that is to say, a dose which you would support without inconvenience,
and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken
the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the end of a month,
when drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person who
drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight
inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this
water.¡±

¡°Do you know any other counter-poisons?¡±

¡°I do not.¡±

¡°I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,¡± said
Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, ¡°and had always considered
it a fable.¡±

¡°No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell me,
madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query, for
two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for a
very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind.¡±

¡°True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and
mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples
frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life
of individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love
affair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a
Flamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.¡±

¡°And the more, madame,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°as the Orientals do not
confine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his
poisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their
hands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an
offensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings, the
other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea, snake-
wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in their
way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or Greek, whom
here you call ¡®good women,¡¯ who do not know how, by means of chemistry,
to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor.¡±

¡°Really,¡± said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange
fire at this conversation.

¡°Oh, yes, indeed, madame,¡± continued Monte Cristo, ¡°the secret dramas of
the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion¡ªbegin
with paradise and end with¡ªhell. There are as many elixirs of every kind
as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature
of humanity; and I will say further¡ªthe art of these chemists is capable
with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and
the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.¡±

¡°But, sir,¡± remarked the young woman, ¡°these Eastern societies, in the
midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as
fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can
easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and
Bassora of the Thousand and One Nights. The sultans and viziers who rule
over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the
government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only
pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has
been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole
story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and
ennui.¡±

¡°By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,
disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are
police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,
behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible
manner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape
human justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning
stratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or
cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose
of, goes straight to the grocer¡¯s or druggist¡¯s, gives a false name,
which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under
the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or
six grammes of arsenic¡ªif he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to five
or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only five or
six times more easily traced;¡ªthen, when he has acquired his specific,
he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of arsenic
which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without rhyme
or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire
neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables. They
fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails
and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a hundred
newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and the
murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists,
come and say, ¡®It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;¡¯ and
rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize
twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated,
confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if
she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for life. This is
the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry, madame. Desrues
was, however, I must confess, more skilful.¡±

¡°What would you have, sir?¡± said the lady, laughing; ¡°we do what we can.
All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.¡±

¡°Now,¡± replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, ¡°shall I tell you the
cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by what
at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see persons
swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring, and fall
dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and the
spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder;
they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office, nor the
corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the whole
thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way from France¡ªgo either to
Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome, and you will see people
passing by you in the streets¡ªpeople erect, smiling, and fresh-colored,
of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle,
would say, ¡®That man was poisoned three weeks ago; he will be a dead man
in a month.¡¯¡±

¡°Then,¡± remarked Madame de Villefort, ¡°they have again discovered the
secret of the famous aqua Tofana that they said was lost at Perugia.¡±

¡°Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about
and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the
vulgar do not follow them¡ªthat is all; but there is always the same
result. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another¡ªone on the
stomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the
poison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or
some other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,
by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were
not, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by
foolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in
favor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a human
being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of whom
justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my
acquaintance, the worthy Abb¨¦ Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has
studied these national phenomena very profoundly.¡±

¡°It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,¡± said the young lady,
motionless with attention. ¡°I thought, I must confess, that these tales,
were inventions of the Middle Ages.¡±

¡°Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,
rewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead
society towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect
until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and
that is half the battle.¡±

¡°So,¡± added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,
¡°the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Ren¨¦es, the Ruggieris, and
later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so
misused by modern drama and romance¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more,¡± replied the count. ¡°Do
you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere
individual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds,
trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them. Thus,
for instance, the excellent Abb¨¦ Adelmonte, of whom I spoke just now,
made in this way some marvellous experiments.¡±

¡°Really?¡±

¡°Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full
of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he
selected the most simple¡ªa cabbage, for instance. For three days he
watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the
cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the
eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome
appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abb¨¦ Adelmonte. He then took the
cabbage to the room where he had rabbits¡ªfor the Abb¨¦ Adelmonte had a
collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his
collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abb¨¦ Adelmonte
took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died.
What magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything
against this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation
against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats,
and guinea-pigs they have killed?¡ªnot one. So, then, the rabbit dies,
and justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abb¨¦ Adelmonte has
its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this
dunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken
ill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the
convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many
vultures in Adelmonte¡¯s country); this bird darts on the dead fowl, and
carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days
afterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since
that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds,
and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat
greedily always, as everybody knows¡ªwell, they feast on the vulture. Now
suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at
the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest
will be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight or
ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the
pylorus. The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound
learning, ¡®The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid
fever!¡¯¡±

¡°But,¡± remarked Madame de Villefort, ¡°all these circumstances which you
link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the
vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the fish-
pond.¡±

¡°Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the East,
one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.¡±

Madame de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively.

¡°But,¡± she exclaimed, suddenly, ¡°arsenic is indelible, indestructible;
in whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of
the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity
to cause death.¡±

¡°Precisely so,¡± cried Monte Cristo¡ª¡°precisely so; and this is what I
said to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by
a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ¡®My son,
the world was not made in a day¡ªbut in seven. Return on Sunday.¡¯ On the
Sunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his
cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of
salts, having their basis in strychnine, strychnos colubrina, as the
learned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of
disease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust; yet,
five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at the
rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the vultures;
so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had
disappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar
indication in any organ¡ªan excitement of the nervous system¡ªthat was it;
a case of cerebral congestion¡ªnothing more. The fowl had not been
poisoned¡ªshe had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among
fowls, I believe, but very common among men.¡±

Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.

¡°It is very fortunate,¡± she observed, ¡°that such substances could only
be prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning
each other.¡±

¡°By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,¡± said Monte
Cristo carelessly.

¡°And then,¡± said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and
with effort, to get away from her thoughts, ¡°however skilfully it is
prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it does
not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are in
cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell¡ªthat is the
point.¡±

30075m


¡°Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure
mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of
Jean Jacques Rousseau,¡ªyou remember,¡ªthe mandarin who is killed five
hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man¡¯s whole life
passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by
reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and
brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will
administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe
on which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of
which we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule¡ªeccentric
or stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to thirty-
six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings excited
beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is permissible in
philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym, then, instead
of committing an ignoble assassination you make an ¡®elimination;¡¯ you
merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your
way, and that without shock or violence, without the display of the
sufferings which, in the case of becoming a punishment, make a martyr of
the victim, and a butcher, in every sense of the word, of him who
inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no groans, no convulsions,
and above all, no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment
of accomplishing the act,¡ªthen one escapes the clutch of the human law,
which says, ¡®Do not disturb society!¡¯ This is the mode in which they
manage these things, and succeed in Eastern climes, where there are
grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of
time in conjunctures of importance.¡±

¡°Yet conscience remains,¡± remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated
voice, and with a stifled sigh.

¡°Yes,¡± answered Monte Cristo ¡°happily, yes, conscience does remain; and
if it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring
exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a
thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons,
howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little
before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard III.,
for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the
putting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,
¡®These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited
the vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their
juvenile propensities¡ªthese two children are impediments in my way of
promoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they
(the children) would infallibly have caused.¡¯ Thus was Lady Macbeth
served by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her
husband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is a
great virtue, a powerful motive¡ªso powerful that it excuses a multitude
of things, even if, after Duncan¡¯s death, Lady Macbeth had been at all
pricked by her conscience.¡±

Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and
horrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity
which was peculiar to him.

After a moment¡¯s silence, the lady inquired:

¡°Do you know, my dear count,¡± she said, ¡°that you are a very terrible
reasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered
medium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through
alembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the
elixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost
instantaneously¡ª¡ª¡±

30077m


¡°Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; one drop of that elixir
sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would have
impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most
violent palpitations; six would have suspended his respiration, and
caused syncope more serious than that in which he was; ten would have
destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched him from those
phials which he so imprudently touched?¡±

¡°Is it then so terrible a poison?¡±

¡°Oh, no! In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does not
exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons,
which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.¡±

¡°What, then, is it?¡±

¡°A skilful preparation of my friend¡¯s the worthy Abb¨¦ Adelmonte, who
taught me the use of it.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± observed Madame de Villefort, ¡°it must be an admirable anti-
spasmodic.¡±

¡°Perfect, madame, as you have seen,¡± replied the count; ¡°and I
frequently make use of it¡ªwith all possible prudence though, be it
observed,¡± he added with a smile of intelligence.

¡°Most assuredly,¡± responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. ¡°As
for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require a
Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and
tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of
suffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in
France, and your abb¨¦ is not probably disposed to make a journey to
Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche¡¯s anti-
spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman¡¯s drops are among my favorite remedies.
Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they are
compounded doubly strong.¡±

Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to
him, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who
thoroughly appreciated their composition.

¡°They are indeed exquisite,¡± he said; ¡°but as they are necessarily
submitted to the process of deglutition¡ªa function which it is
frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish¡ªI prefer my
own specific.¡±

¡°Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen
produced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as to
ask it of you.¡±

¡°But I,¡± said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke¡ª¡°I am gallant enough to
offer it you.¡±

30079m


¡°How kind you are.¡±

¡°Only remember one thing¡ªa small dose is a remedy, a large one is
poison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will
inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into
a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor.
But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were prescribing for
you.¡±

The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of
Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.

¡°If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,
count, instead of only for the second,¡± said Madame de Villefort; ¡°if I
had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the
happiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on
detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first
refusal.¡±

¡°A thousand thanks, madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo ¡°but I have an
engagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the
Acad¨¦mie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your
grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.¡±

¡°Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.¡±

¡°Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour¡¯s conversation
I have had with you, which is indeed impossible.¡±

Monte Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained
immersed in thought.

¡°He is a very strange man,¡± she said, ¡°and in my opinion is himself the
Adelmonte he talks about.¡±

As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations.

¡°Good,¡± said he, as he went away; ¡°this is a fruitful soil, and I feel
certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.¡±

Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription
requested.






Chapter 53. Robert le Diable

The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as
there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction
at the Acad¨¦mie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe
illness, made his reappearance in the character of Bertram, and, as
usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite
composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his
orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least
a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance;
he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box. Chateau-
Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a journalist,
had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened that on this
particular night the minister¡¯s box was placed at the disposal of Lucien
Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again, upon his
rejection of it by Merc¨¦d¨¨s, sent it to Danglars, with an intimation
that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and
her daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box
in question. The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to
dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the presentation of a
gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire,
who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king¡¯s ransom in his
waistcoat pocket.

Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a
ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his
parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not
permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched
a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly
impossible for her to go alone with Eug¨¦nie to the opera.

There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction
would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone
without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her
mother¡¯s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice
and ill-nature. One must take the world as one finds it.

30083m


The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of
the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until
after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is
generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that
part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in
observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of
opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation.

¡°Surely,¡± said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened,
¡°that must be the Countess G¡ª¡ª.¡±

¡°And who is the Countess G¡ª¡ª?¡± inquired Chateau-Renaud.

¡°What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick a
quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the
Countess G¡ª¡ª was.¡±

¡°Ah, to be sure,¡± replied Chateau-Renaud; ¡°the lovely Venetian, is it
not?¡±

¡°Herself.¡± At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned
his salutation with a smile.

¡°You know her, it seems?¡± said Chateau-Renaud.

¡°Franz introduced me to her at Rome,¡± replied Albert.

¡°Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in
Rome?¡±

¡°With pleasure.¡±

There was a cry of ¡°Shut up!¡± from the audience. This manifestation on
the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the
music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who
continued their conversation.

¡°The countess was present at the races in the Champ-de-Mars,¡± said
Chateau-Renaud.

¡°Today?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?¡±

¡°Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.¡±

¡°And who was the winner?¡±

¡°Nautilus. I staked on him.¡±

¡°But there were three races, were there not?¡±

¡°Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club¡ªa gold cup, you
know¡ªand a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.¡±

¡°What was it?¡±

¡°Oh, shut up!¡± again interposed some of the audience.

¡°Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.¡±

¡°Is that possible?¡±

¡°True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the
name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last moment,
a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,
presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at
least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider¡¯s pockets, to make
him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against
whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.¡±

¡°And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey
belonged?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?¡±

¡°Exactly; that was the title.¡±

¡°Then,¡± answered Albert, ¡°I am better informed than you are, and know
who the owner of that horse was.¡±

¡°Shut up, there!¡± cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and
manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility
that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate
was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized
the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one
person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they
deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge,
the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to
busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the
minister¡¯s box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter,
entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to
their seats.

¡°Ha, ha,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°here come some friends of yours,
viscount! What are you looking at there? don¡¯t you see they are trying
to catch your eye?¡±

Albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan
from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie, she scarcely vouchsafed
to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of
the stage.

¡°I tell you what, my dear fellow,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°I cannot
imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle
Danglars¡ªthat is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat
inferior rank, which by the way I don¡¯t think you care very much about.
Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!¡±

¡°Handsome, certainly,¡± replied Albert, ¡°but not to my taste, which I
confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.¡±

¡°Ah, well,¡± exclaimed Chateau-Renaud, who because he had seen his
thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of
paternal air with his more youthful friend, ¡°you young people are never
satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you a
bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not
content.¡±

¡°No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked
something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this
chase-loving Diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a
sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Act?on.¡±

And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to
comprehend the justness of Morcerf¡¯s remark. She was beautiful, but her
beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious
taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat
rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by
well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost
habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of
firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler
attributes of her sex¡ªher nose was precisely what a sculptor would have
chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found
fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered
still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting
vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the
almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark
mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally
are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to
increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her
countenance.

The rest of Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie¡¯s person was in perfect keeping with
the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as Chateau-
Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute.

As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was
the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty,
that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person.
She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote poetry, and
composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely
devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance, assisted by a
schoolfellow,¡ªa young woman without fortune whose talent promised to
develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored that she was
an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers
of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her
voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence.
But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to
commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a
theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the banker¡¯s daughter,
though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d¡¯Armilly (that
was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the
day, took especial care not to be seen in her company. Still, though not
actually received at the H?tel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged
friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than
is usually bestowed on a governess.

The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame
Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed
half-hour¡¯s interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were
left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive
visits in their respective boxes.

Morcerf and Chateau-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of
this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that
this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his
impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her
daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.
Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of
the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her
mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the Countess
G¡ª¡ª, and where Morcerf had just made his appearance.

30087m


¡°So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?¡± cried the countess,
extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old
acquaintance; ¡°it was really very good of you to recognize me so
quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me.¡±

¡°Be assured,¡± replied Albert, ¡°that if I had been aware of your arrival
in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects to
you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de Chateau-
Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France, and
from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in
the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.¡±

Chateau-Renaud bowed to the countess.

¡°So you were at the races, baron?¡± inquired the countess eagerly.

¡°Yes, madame.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± pursued Madame G¡ª¡ª with considerable animation, ¡°you can
probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?¡±

¡°I am sorry to say I cannot,¡± replied the baron; ¡°and I was just asking
the same question of Albert.¡±

¡°Are you very anxious to know, countess?¡± asked Albert.

¡°To know what?¡±

¡°The name of the owner of the winning horse?¡±

¡°Excessively; only imagine¡ªbut do tell me, viscount, whether you really
are acquainted with it or no?¡±

¡°I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,
were you not? You said, ¡®only imagine,¡¯¡ªand then paused. Pray continue.¡±

¡°Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid
roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a
pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their
success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were
at stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the
winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with
joy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I
met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I
concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse
must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments,
I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and
rider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written
these words¡ª¡®From Lord Ruthven to Countess G¡ª¡ª.¡¯¡±

¡°Precisely; I was sure of it,¡± said Morcerf.

¡°Sure of what?¡±

¡°That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.¡±

¡°What Lord Ruthven do you mean?¡±

¡°Why, our Lord Ruthven¡ªthe Vampire of the Salle Argentina!¡±

¡°Is it possible?¡± exclaimed the countess; ¡°is he here in Paris?¡±

¡°To be sure,¡ªwhy not?¡±

¡°And you visit him?¡ªmeet him at your own house and elsewhere?¡±

¡°I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Chateau-Renaud
has also the honor of his acquaintance.¡±

¡°But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club
prize?¡±

¡°Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?¡±

¡°What of that?¡±

¡°Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I
was made prisoner?¡±

¡°Oh, yes.¡±

¡°And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?¡±

¡°To be sure, I remember it all now.¡±

¡°He called himself Vampa. You see, it¡¯s evident where the count got the
name.¡±

¡°But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?¡±

¡°In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may
believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman
take so lively an interest in his success.¡±

¡°I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish
remarks we used to make about him?¡±

¡°I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his
presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.¡±

¡°Does his action appear like that of an enemy?¡±

¡°No; certainly not.¡±

¡°Well, then¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°And so he is in Paris?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And what effect does he produce?¡±

¡°Why,¡± said Albert, ¡°he was talked about for a week; then the coronation
of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of
Mademoiselle Mars¡¯s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.¡±

¡°My good fellow,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°the count is your friend and you
treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you,
countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by
the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon
myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding act
upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000
francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
preservation of Madame de Villefort¡¯s life; now it seems that he has
carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain,
in spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest
at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a
month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,
after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.¡±

¡°Perhaps you are right,¡± said Morcerf; ¡°meanwhile, who is in the Russian
ambassador¡¯s box?¡±

¡°Which box do you mean?¡± asked the countess.

¡°The one between the pillars on the first tier¡ªit seems to have been
fitted up entirely afresh.¡±

¡°Did you observe anyone during the first act?¡± asked Chateau-Renaud.

¡°Where?¡±

¡°In that box.¡±

¡°No,¡± replied the countess, ¡°it was certainly empty during the first
act;¡± then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she
said, ¡°And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte
Cristo that gained the prize?¡±

¡°I am sure of it.¡±

¡°And who afterwards sent the cup to me?¡±

¡°Undoubtedly.¡±

¡°But I don¡¯t know him,¡± said the countess; ¡°I have a great mind to
return it.¡±

¡°Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed
of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is his
way, and you must take him as you find him.¡±

At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain
for the second act. Albert rose to return to his place.

¡°Shall I see you again?¡± asked the countess.

¡°At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and
inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?¡±

¡°Pray take notice,¡± said the countess, ¡°that my present residence is 22
Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday
evening. So now, you are both forewarned.¡±

The young men bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls,
they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and
directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian
ambassador. A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in
deep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after
the Eastern style. The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich
magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her.

¡°Hullo,¡± said Albert; ¡°it is Monte Cristo and his Greek!¡±

The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Hayd¨¦e. In a few
moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house,
and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her
magnificent diamonds.

The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices¡ªone deep
whisper¡ªintimating that some great and universally interesting event had
occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were occupied with the young and
beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most
extraordinary spectacle.

Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated
her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the
second act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would
permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the close
of the act he therefore went to the baroness.

Having bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand to Debray. By the
baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eug¨¦nie received him
with her accustomed coldness.

¡°My dear fellow,¡± said Debray, ¡°you have come in the nick of time. There
is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she
insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage,
where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no disciple of
Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of
the scrape, I said, ¡®Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of his
beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers¡¯ ends;¡¯ whereupon the baroness
signified her desire to see you.¡±

¡°Is it not almost incredible,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°that a person
having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,
should possess so little information?¡±

¡°Let me assure you, madame,¡± said Lucien, ¡°that had I really the sum you
mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in
troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte
Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich
as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray
settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I
care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.¡±

30093m


¡°I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth
32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000
francs each.¡±

¡°He seems to have a mania for diamonds,¡± said Morcerf, smiling, ¡°and I
verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for the
sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint
stones.¡±

¡°Perhaps he has discovered some mine,¡± said Madame Danglars. ¡°I suppose
you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron¡¯s banking
establishment?¡±

¡°I was not aware of it,¡± replied Albert, ¡°but I can readily believe it.¡±

¡°And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only
staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six
millions.

¡°He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling incog.¡±

¡°Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?¡±
inquired Eug¨¦nie.

¡°I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms
of another as yourself,¡± responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his
eye. ¡°A most lovely creature, upon my soul!¡± was his verdict.

¡°Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?¡± inquired Eug¨¦nie; ¡°does
anybody know?¡±

¡°Mademoiselle,¡± said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, ¡°I can give
you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points
relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing¡ªthe
young woman is a Greek.¡±

¡°So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that,
everyone here is as well-informed as yourself.¡±

¡°I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone,¡± replied
Morcerf, ¡°but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing
further to communicate¡ªyes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely, that
she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with
the count, I heard the sound of a guzla¡ªit is impossible that it could
have been touched by any other finger than her own.¡±

¡°Then your count entertains visitors, does he?¡± asked Madame Danglars.

¡°Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.¡±

¡°I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,
or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.¡±

¡°What,¡± said Debray, laughing; ¡°do you really mean you would go to his
house?¡±

¡°Why not? my husband could accompany me.¡±

¡°But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?¡±

¡°You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,¡± said the
baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.

¡°No, no!¡± exclaimed Debray; ¡°that girl is not his wife: he told us
himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us
so at your breakfast?¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± said the baroness, ¡°if slave she be, she has all the air
and manner of a princess.¡±

¡°Of the ¡®Arabian Nights¡¯.¡±

¡°If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes a
princess. Why, diamonds¡ªand she is covered with them.¡±

¡°To me she seems overloaded,¡± observed Eug¨¦nie; ¡°she would look far
better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely
formed throat and wrists.¡±

¡°See how the artist peeps out!¡± exclaimed Madame Danglars. ¡°My poor
Eug¨¦nie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.¡±

¡°I admire all that is beautiful,¡± returned the young lady.

¡°What do you think of the count?¡± inquired Debray; ¡°he is not much
amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.¡±

¡°The count,¡± repeated Eug¨¦nie, as though it had not occurred to her to
observe him sooner; ¡°the count?¡ªoh, he is so dreadfully pale.¡±

¡°I quite agree with you,¡± said Morcerf; ¡°and the secret of that very
pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G¡ª¡ª insists upon it
that he is a vampire.¡±

¡°Then the Countess G¡ª¡ª has returned to Paris, has she?¡± inquired the
baroness.

¡°Is that she, mamma?¡± asked Eug¨¦nie; ¡°almost opposite to us, with that
profusion of beautiful light hair?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°that is she. Shall I tell you what you
ought to do, Morcerf?¡±

¡°Command me, madame.¡±

¡°Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us.¡±

¡°What for?¡± asked Eug¨¦nie.

¡°What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no
desire to meet him?¡±

¡°None whatever,¡± replied Eug¨¦nie.

¡°Strange child,¡± murmured the baroness.

¡°He will very probably come of his own accord,¡± said Morcerf. ¡°There; do
you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.¡±

The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful
manner.

¡°Well,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself
away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any
means of speaking to him.¡±

¡°Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.¡±

¡°But I have never been presented.¡±

¡°Presented to whom?¡±

¡°To the beautiful Greek.¡±

¡°You say she is only a slave?¡±

¡°While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I
hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.¡±

¡°That is possible¡ªgo.¡±

¡°I am going,¡± said Albert, as he made his parting bow.

Just as he was passing the count¡¯s box, the door opened, and Monte
Cristo came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the
lobby, the count took Albert¡¯s arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali
placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round
the Nubian.

¡°Upon my word,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°Paris is a strange city, and the
Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected
around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one
might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can
promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in
Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that
way.¡±

¡°That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste
their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as
far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is
merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant¡ªyou, who are at
this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.¡±

¡°Really? and what has procured me so flattering a distinction?¡±

¡°What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand
louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the
name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not
larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy
of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first
handsome woman you think of!¡±

¡°And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?¡±

¡°Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the
by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others;
secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp¡¯s journal; and thirdly, from my
own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse
Vampa?¡±

¡°That was an oversight, certainly,¡± replied the count; ¡°but tell me,
does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking for
him, but without success.¡±

¡°He will be here tonight.¡±

¡°In what part of the house?¡±

¡°In the baroness¡¯s box, I believe.¡±

¡°That charming young woman with her is her daughter?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I congratulate you.¡±

Morcerf smiled.

¡°We will discuss that subject at length some future time,¡± said he. ¡°But
what do you think of the music?¡±

¡°What music?¡±

¡°Why, the music you have been listening to.¡±

¡°Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by
featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.¡±

¡°From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy
the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?¡±

30097m


¡°You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more
exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go
to sleep.¡±

¡°Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what else
was opera invented for?¡±

¡°No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner I
speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain
preparation¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I know¡ªthe famous hashish!¡±

¡°Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with
music come and sup with me.¡±

¡°I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,¡± said
Morcerf.

¡°Do you mean at Rome?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°Ah, then, I suppose you heard Hayd¨¦e¡¯s guzla; the poor exile frequently
beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native
land.¡±

Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into a
silent reverie.

The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain.

¡°You will excuse my leaving you,¡± said the count, turning in the
direction of his box.

¡°What? Are you going?¡±

¡°Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G¡ª¡ª on the part of her
friend the vampire.¡±

¡°And what message shall I convey to the baroness!¡±

¡°That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my
respects in the course of the evening.¡±

The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,
according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame
Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either
interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence,
therefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in
which he had just seated himself.

The quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming; and a slight
though meaning smile passed over his lips. Hayd¨¦e, whose soul seemed
centred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated natures,
delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear.

30099m


The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julia, and
Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the
Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking
his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides,
the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle.
After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from
the theatre into the lobbies and salon.

The count left his box, and a moment later was saluting the Baronne
Danglars, who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise.

¡°You are welcome, count!¡± she exclaimed, as he entered. ¡°I have been
most anxious to see you, that I might repeat orally the thanks writing
can so ill express.¡±

¡°Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your
remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.¡±

¡°But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day after
your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame de
Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity
restored to me.¡±

30101m


¡°This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my
Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.¡±

¡°Was it Ali,¡± asked the Count of Morcerf, ¡°who rescued my son from the
hands of bandits?¡±

¡°No, count,¡± replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the
general; ¡°in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks;
but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt¡ªif
indeed there existed one¡ªand I feel almost mortified to find you still
reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with
an introduction to your daughter?¡±

¡°Oh, you are no stranger¡ªat least not by name,¡± replied Madame Danglars,
¡°and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but
you. Eug¨¦nie,¡± continued the baroness, turning towards her daughter,
¡°this is the Count of Monte Cristo.¡±

The count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly.

¡°You have a charming young person with you tonight, count,¡± said
Eug¨¦nie. ¡°Is she your daughter?¡±

¡°No, mademoiselle,¡± said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. ¡°She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my
care.¡±

¡°And what is her name?¡±

¡°Hayd¨¦e,¡± replied Monte Cristo.

¡°A Greek?¡± murmured the Count of Morcerf.

¡°Yes, indeed, count,¡± said Madame Danglars; ¡°and tell me, did you ever
see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly
served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?¡±

¡°Did I hear rightly, monsieur,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°that you served at
Yanina?¡±

¡°I was inspector-general of the pasha¡¯s troops,¡± replied Morcerf; ¡°and
it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality
of the illustrious Albanese chief.¡±

¡°But look!¡± exclaimed Madame Danglars.

¡°Where?¡± stammered Morcerf.

¡°There,¡± said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and
leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Hayd¨¦e, whose eyes
were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,
perceived his pale features close to Morcerf¡¯s face. It was as if the
young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to
assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint
cry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people
about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door.

¡°Why, count,¡± exclaimed Eug¨¦nie, ¡°what has happened to your ward? she
seems to have been taken suddenly ill.

¡°Very probably,¡± answered the count. ¡°But do not be alarmed on her
account. Hayd¨¦e¡¯s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is
peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers¡ªnay, there are some
which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,¡±
continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, ¡°I have
an infallible remedy.¡±

So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a
parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame
Danglars¡¯ box. Upon his return to Hayd¨¦e he found her still very pale.
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist and
icy cold.

¡°Who was it you were talking with over there?¡± she asked.

¡°With the Count of Morcerf,¡± answered Monte Cristo. ¡°He tells me he
served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.¡±

¡°Wretch!¡± exclaimed Hayd¨¦e, her eyes flashing with rage; ¡°he sold my
father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his
treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?¡±

¡°Something of this I heard in Epirus,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°but the
particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my
child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.¡±

¡°Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain
long near that dreadful man.¡±

So saying, Hayd¨¦e arose, and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white
cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box
at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act.

¡°Do you observe,¡± said the Countess G¡ª¡ª to Albert, who had returned to
her side, ¡°that man does nothing like other people; he listens most
devoutly to the third act of Robert le Diable, and when the fourth
begins, takes his departure.¡±






Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks

Some days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of
Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, which had already
assumed that palace-like appearance which the count¡¯s princely fortune
enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. He came to
renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to
the count through the medium of a letter, signed ¡°Baronne Danglars, n¨¦e
Hermine de Servieux.¡±

Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friend¡¯s
conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the
count¡¯s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. He was convinced
that Lucien¡¯s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity, the larger
half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin. In
short, Madame Danglars, not being able personally to examine in detail
the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away
horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera with a Greek slave
wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money, had deputed those
eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to give her a faithful account
of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person. But the count did
not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection
between Lucien¡¯s visit and the curiosity of the baroness.

¡°You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?¡± the count
inquired of Albert de Morcerf.

¡°Yes, count, you know what I told you?¡±

¡°All remains the same, then, in that quarter?¡±

¡°It is more than ever a settled thing,¡± said Lucien,¡ªand, considering
that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,
he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed
cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and
the pictures.

¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°I did not expect that the affair would be so
promptly concluded.¡±

¡°Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are
forgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and when,
again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at the
progress they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M.
Danglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars
in the commissariat department. It was there that my father, ruined by
the revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony,
both laid the foundations of their different fortunes.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit
which I paid him; and,¡± continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien,
who was turning over the leaves of an album, ¡°Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie is
pretty¡ªI think I remember that to be her name.¡±

¡°Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,¡± replied Albert, ¡°but of that
style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.¡±

¡°You speak as if you were already her husband.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was
doing.

¡°Really,¡± said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, ¡°you do not appear to
me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.¡±

¡°Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°and that
frightens me.¡±

¡°Bah,¡± exclaimed Monte Cristo, ¡°that¡¯s a fine reason to give. Are you
not rich yourself?¡±

¡°My father¡¯s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give
me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.¡±

¡°That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris
especially,¡± said the count; ¡°but everything does not depend on wealth,
and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high station
in society. Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and then
the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see the
integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin;
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine.
As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most
suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.¡±

Albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.

¡°There is still something else,¡± said he.

¡°I confess,¡± observed Monte Cristo, ¡°that I have some difficulty in
comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and
beautiful.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is
not all on my side.¡±

¡°Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the
marriage.¡±

¡°It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment,
and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account for it, but
she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.¡±

30107m


¡°Ah,¡± said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, ¡°that may be easily
explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement
itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with
one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.¡±

¡°I do not know if that is her reason,¡± said Albert, ¡°but one thing I do
know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite
miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to
talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of
indisposition¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Real?¡± interrupted the count, smiling.

¡°Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,¡ªat any rate they postponed the
matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet twenty-
one, and Eug¨¦nie is only seventeen; but the two months expire next week.
It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my mind is
harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!¡±

¡°Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from being
so?¡±

¡°Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not
marry Mademoiselle Danglars.¡±

¡°Marry her then,¡± said the count, with a significant shrug of the
shoulders.

¡°Yes,¡± replied Morcerf, ¡°but that will plunge my mother into positive
grief.¡±

¡°Then do not marry her,¡± said the count.

¡°Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing to
be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible
extricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give pain
to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.¡±

Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.

¡°Ah,¡± said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at
the farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right
hand and an account book in his left, ¡°what are you doing there? Are you
making a sketch after Poussin?¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± was the tranquil response; ¡°I am too fond of art to attempt
anything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in arithmetic.¡±

¡°In arithmetic?¡±

¡°Yes; I am calculating¡ªby the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns
you¡ªI am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the
last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days,
and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made
300,000 livres.¡±

¡°That is not his biggest scoop,¡± said Morcerf; ¡°did he not make a
million in Spaniards this last year?¡±

¡°My dear fellow,¡± said Lucien, ¡°here is the Count of Monte Cristo, who
will say to you, as the Italians do,¡ª

¡°¡®Denaro e santit¨¤, Met¨¤ della met¨¤.¡¯9 ¡°When they tell me such things, I
only shrug my shoulders and say nothing.¡±

¡°But you were speaking of Haitians?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Ah, Haitians,¡ªthat is quite another thing! Haitians are the ¨¦cart¨¦ of
French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be
enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always
come back to ¨¦cart¨¦¡ªit is not only a game, it is a hors-d¡¯?uvre! M.
Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but
waited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of
gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.¡±

¡°And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?¡± asked Monte
Cristo. ¡°I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues.¡±

¡°Because,¡± said Albert, laughing, ¡°one piece of news follows another,
and there is often great dissimilarity between them.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the count, ¡°I see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at
gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.¡±

¡°It is not he who plays!¡± exclaimed Lucien; ¡°it is Madame Danglars; she
is indeed daring.¡±

¡°But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how little
dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the fountain-
head, surely you ought to prevent it,¡± said Morcerf, with a smile.

¡°How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?¡± asked Lucien; ¡°you
know the character of the baroness¡ªno one has any influence with her,
and she does precisely what she pleases.¡±

¡°Ah, if I were in your place¡ª¡ª¡± said Albert.

¡°Well?¡±

¡°I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future son-
in-law.¡±

¡°How would you set about it?¡±

¡°Ah, that would be easy enough¡ªI would give her a lesson.¡±

¡°A lesson?¡±

¡°Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority
great on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but
the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to lose a
hundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.¡±

¡°I do not understand,¡± stammered Lucien.

¡°It is very clear, notwithstanding,¡± replied the young man, with an
artlessness wholly free from affectation; ¡°tell her some fine morning an
unheard-of piece of intelligence¡ªsome telegraphic despatch, of which you
alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV. was seen yesterday
at Gabrielle¡¯s. That would boom the market; she will buy heavily, and
she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the following day, in
his gazette, ¡®The report circulated by some usually well-informed
persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielle¡¯s house, is
totally without foundation. We can positively assert that his majesty
did not quit the Pont-Neuf.¡¯¡±

Lucien half smiled. Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had
not lost one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had even
read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary. This
embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to
shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in taking
leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he answered,
¡°Willingly, count; I accept.¡± The count returned to young Morcerf.

¡°Do you not think, on reflection,¡± said he to him, ¡°that you have done
wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of M.
Debray?¡±

¡°My dear count,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°I beg of you not to apply that title so
prematurely.¡±

¡°Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very
much averse to this marriage?¡±

¡°So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole
life.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said the count, ¡°I am emboldened to speak openly to you. M.
Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with
politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
enabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of
dinners and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be
beforehand with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting
M. and Madame Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to my country-
house at Auteuil. If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of
Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of being a
matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the
affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to
bring his daughter. In that case your mother would hold me in aversion,
and I do not at all wish that; on the contrary, I desire to stand high
in her esteem.¡±

¡°Indeed, count,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°I thank you sincerely for having used so
much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you
propose. You say you desire my mother¡¯s good opinion; I assure you it is
already yours to a very unusual extent.¡±

30111m


¡°Do you think so?¡± said Monte Cristo, with interest.

¡°Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the
other day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could know
of this attention on your part¡ªand I will venture to tell her¡ªI am sure
that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father will be
equally angry.¡± The count laughed.

¡°Well,¡± said he to Morcerf, ¡°but I think your father will not be the
only angry one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered
person. They know that I am intimate with you¡ªthat you are, in fact; one
of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintances¡ªand they will not find you at
my house; they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you. Be sure
to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a
semblance of probability, and communicate the fact to me by a line in
writing. You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will
be valid.¡±

¡°I will do better than that,¡± said Albert; ¡°my mother is wishing to go
to the sea-side¡ªwhat day is fixed for your dinner?¡±

¡°Saturday.¡±

¡°This is Tuesday¡ªwell, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day after we
shall be at Tr¨¦port. Really, count, you have a delightful way of setting
people at their ease.¡±

¡°Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do what
will be agreeable to you, that is all.¡±

¡°When shall you send your invitations?¡±

¡°This very day.¡±

¡°Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my
mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow. I have not seen you,
consequently I know nothing of your dinner.¡±

¡°How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen
you at my house?¡±

¡°Ah, true.¡±

¡°Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any ceremony,
when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to
accept, as you were going to Tr¨¦port.¡±

¡°Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my mother
before tomorrow?¡±

¡°Before tomorrow?¡ªthat will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides, I
shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.¡±

¡°Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but, if
you accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.¡±

¡°What must I do to attain such sublimity?¡±

¡°You are today free as air¡ªcome and dine with me; we shall be a small
party¡ªonly yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely seen my mother;
you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely. She is a
remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist another
like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure you, there
would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As to my
father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines with
the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who have
seen the whole world, will relate your adventures¡ªyou shall tell us the
history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the
Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a princess. We
will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation, and my mother
will thank you.¡±

¡°A thousand thanks,¡± said the count, ¡°your invitation is most gracious,
and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it. I am
not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most
important engagement.¡±

¡°Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an
invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require the
proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am
quite as incredulous as he is.¡±

¡°I am going to give you a proof,¡± replied the count, and he rang the
bell.

¡°Humph,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°this is the second time you have refused to dine
with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.¡±

Monte Cristo started. ¡°Oh, you do not mean that,¡± said he; ¡°besides,
here comes the confirmation of my assertion.¡±

Baptistin entered, and remained standing at the door.

¡°I had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?¡±

¡°Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer
for it.¡±

¡°At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner.¡±

¡°Probably not.¡±

¡°Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I called
you into my laboratory?¡±

¡°To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five,¡±
replied the valet.

¡°What then?¡±

¡°Ah, my dear count,¡± said Albert.

¡°No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have
given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred.
I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.¡±

¡°Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.¡±

¡°You hear¡ªMajor Bartolomeo Cavalcanti¡ªa man who ranks amongst the most
ancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth
canto of The Inferno, you remember it, do you not? Then there is his
son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount, bearing
the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into the
Parisian world, aided by his father¡¯s millions. The major will bring his
son with him this evening, the contino, as we say in Italy; he confides
him to my care. If he proves himself worthy of it, I will do what I can
to advance his interests. You will assist me in the work, will you not?¡±

¡°Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
then?¡±

¡°By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
agreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of very
ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence, Bologna and
Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in
Paris. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on
one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once
paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were
likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose
society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. This
good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris, which he
only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire, when he was on
his way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his
son to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I shall let him follow
in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then I shall have done my
part.¡±

¡°Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor,¡± said Albert ¡°Good-bye, we
shall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.¡±

¡°Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?¡±

¡°I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says you
were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy;
I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains.¡±

¡°His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?¡±

¡°No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible
and mysterious of beings.¡±

¡°He is a charming young man,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°and I felt a lively
interest in him the very first evening of my introduction, when I met
him in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of
mine. He is, I think, the son of General d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡±

¡°He is.¡±

¡°The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?¡±

¡°By the Bonapartists.¡±

¡°Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial
engagement contemplated for him?¡±

¡°Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡±

30115m


¡°And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,¡± said Albert,
laughing.

¡°You smile.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Why do you do so?¡±

¡°I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for
the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own.
But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of
us; it is unpardonable.¡±

Albert rose.

¡°Are you going?¡±

¡°Really, that is a good idea!¡ªtwo hours have I been boring you to death
with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if I
am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world. And
your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite a
style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get such
a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a
play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit themselves
in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part with M.
Baptistin, give me the refusal of him.¡±

¡°By all means.¡±

¡°That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,
Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing
to establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her
mother¡¯s side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will
help you in the search.¡±

¡°Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.¡±

¡°Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a
hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain
a bachelor, even were it only for ten years.¡±

¡°Nothing is impossible,¡± gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave
of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.
Bertuccio appeared.

¡°Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend entertaining company
on Saturday at Auteuil.¡± Bertuccio slightly started. ¡°I shall require
your services to see that all be properly arranged. It is a beautiful
house, or at all events may be made so.¡±

¡°There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your
excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.¡±

¡°Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of the
sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave that
exactly as it is.¡± Bertuccio bowed. ¡°You will not touch the garden
either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should
prefer that being altered beyond all recognition.¡±

¡°I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your
excellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency¡¯s
commands concerning the dinner.¡±

¡°Really, my dear M. Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°since you have been in
Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your
element; you no longer seem to understand me.¡±

¡°But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are
expecting to receive?¡±

¡°I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do
so. ¡®Lucullus dines with Lucullus,¡¯ that is quite sufficient.¡±

Bertuccio bowed, and left the room.






Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti

Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to
Morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo
as a pretext for declining Albert¡¯s invitation. Seven o¡¯clock had just
struck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given
him, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the
door, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried
away, as if ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about fifty-two
years of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with
black frogs, which have so long maintained their popularity all over
Europe. He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not
of the brightest polish, and a little too thick in the soles, buckskin
gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the
gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with white, which, if the
proprietor had not worn it of his own free will, might have passed for a
halter, so much did it resemble one. Such was the picturesque costume of
the person who rang at the gate, and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in
the Avenue des Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es that the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and
who, being answered by the porter in the affirmative, entered, closed
the gate after him, and began to ascend the steps.

The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray
moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had
received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
awaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was
ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to
meet him with a smiling air.

¡°Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I was expecting you.¡±

¡°Indeed,¡± said the Italian, ¡°was your excellency then aware of my
visit?¡±

¡°Yes; I had been told that I should see you today at seven o¡¯clock.¡±

¡°Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?¡±

¡°Of course.¡±

¡°Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have been
forgotten.¡±

30119m


¡°What precaution?¡±

¡°That of informing you beforehand of my coming.¡±

¡°Oh, no, it has not.¡±

¡°But you are sure you are not mistaken.¡±

¡°Very sure.¡±

¡°It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o¡¯clock this
evening?¡±

¡°I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.¡±

¡°Oh, no, never mind that,¡± said the Italian; ¡°it is not worth the
trouble.¡±

¡°Yes, yes,¡± said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.
¡°Let me see,¡± said the count; ¡°are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,¡± joyfully replied the Italian; ¡°yes, I am really
he.¡±

¡°Ex-major in the Austrian service?¡±

¡°Was I a major?¡± timidly asked the old soldier.

¡°Yes,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°you were a major; that is the title the French
give to the post which you filled in Italy.¡±

¡°Very good,¡± said the major, ¡°I do not demand more, you understand¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?¡± said Monte
Cristo.

¡°No, certainly not.¡±

¡°You were sent by some other person?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°By the excellent Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡±

¡°Exactly so,¡± said the delighted major.

¡°And you have a letter?¡±

¡°Yes, there it is.¡±

¡°Give it to me, then.¡± And Monte Cristo took the letter, which he opened
and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes, and
then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost immediately
reverted to the proprietor of the room.

¡°Yes, yes, I see. ¡®Major Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of Lucca, a
descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence,¡¯¡± continued Monte Cristo,
reading aloud, ¡°¡®possessing an income of half a million.¡¯¡±

Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed.

¡°Half a million,¡± said he, ¡°magnificent!¡±

¡°Half a million, is it?¡± said the major.

¡°Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abb¨¦ knows correctly
the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.¡±

¡°Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea that
it was so much.¡±

¡°Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some reformation
in that quarter.¡±

¡°You have opened my eyes,¡± said the Italian gravely; ¡°I will show the
gentlemen the door.¡±

Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:

¡°¡®And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.¡¯¡±

¡°Yes, indeed but one!¡± said the major with a sigh.

¡°¡®Which is to recover a lost and adored son.¡¯¡±

¡°A lost and adored son!¡±

¡°¡®Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or
by the gypsies.¡¯¡±

¡°At the age of five years!¡± said the major with a deep sigh, and raising
his eye to heaven.

¡°Unhappy father,¡± said Monte Cristo. The count continued:

¡°¡®I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance that you have
the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen
years.¡¯¡±

The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of
anxiety.

¡°I have the power of so doing,¡± said Monte Cristo. The major recovered
his self-possession.

¡°So, then,¡± said he, ¡°the letter was true to the end?¡±

¡°Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?¡±

¡°No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,
as does the Abb¨¦ Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a
joke; but your excellency has not read all.¡±

¡°Ah, true,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°there is a postscript.¡±

¡°Yes, yes,¡± repeated the major, ¡°yes¡ªthere¡ªis¡ªa¡ªpostscript.¡±

¡°¡®In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his
banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
you still owe me.¡¯¡±

The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with
great anxiety.

¡°Very good,¡± said the count.

¡°He said ¡®very good,¡¯¡± muttered the major, ¡°then¡ªsir¡ª¡ª¡± replied he.

¡°Then what?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°Then the postscript¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well; what of the postscript?¡±

¡°Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the
letter?¡±

¡°Certainly; the Abb¨¦ Busoni and myself have a small account open between
us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I am still
owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference. You
attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear Monsieur
Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°I must explain to you,¡± said the major, ¡°that, fully confiding in the
signature of the Abb¨¦ Busoni, I had not provided myself with any other
funds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should have found
myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.¡±

¡°Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed
anywhere?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Why, really I know no one,¡± said the major.

¡°But then you yourself are known to others?¡±

¡°Yes, I am known, so that¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.¡±

¡°So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?¡±

¡°Certainly, at your first request.¡± The major¡¯s eyes dilated with
pleasing astonishment. ¡°But sit down,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°really I do
not know what I have been thinking of¡ªI have positively kept you
standing for the last quarter of an hour.¡±

¡°Don¡¯t mention it.¡± The major drew an armchair towards him, and
proceeded to seat himself.

¡°Now,¡± said the count, ¡°what will you take¡ªa glass of sherry, port, or
Alicante?¡±

¡°Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.¡±

¡°I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it, will
you not?¡±

¡°Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.¡±

Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.

¡°Well?¡± said he in a low voice.

¡°The young man is here,¡± said the valet de chambre in the same tone.

¡°Into what room did you take him?¡±

¡°Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency¡¯s orders.¡±

¡°That¡¯s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.¡±

Baptistin left the room.

¡°Really,¡± said the major, ¡°I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving
you.¡±

¡°Pray don¡¯t mention such a thing,¡± said the count. Baptistin re-entered
with glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled one glass, but in the
other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. The bottle
was covered with spiders¡¯ webs, and all the other signs which indicate
the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man¡¯s face. The major
made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. The count told
Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who began by
sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction, and then
delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.

¡°So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in
great esteem¡ªhad all that could render a man happy?¡±

¡°All,¡± said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, ¡°positively all.¡±

¡°And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
happiness?¡±

¡°Only one thing,¡± said the Italian.

¡°And that one thing, your lost child.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said the major, taking a second biscuit, ¡°that consummation of my
happiness was indeed wanting.¡± The worthy major raised his eyes to
heaven and sighed.

¡°Let me hear, then,¡± said the count, ¡°who this deeply regretted son was;
for I always understood you were a bachelor.¡±

¡°That was the general opinion, sir,¡± said the major, ¡°and I¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied the count, ¡°and you confirmed the report. A youthful
indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the
world at large?¡±

The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm manner, at the
same time casting his eyes down, either to give himself time to compose
his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the while giving an
under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose lips still
announced the same polite curiosity.

¡°Yes,¡± said the major, ¡°I did wish this fault to be hidden from every
eye.¡±

¡°Not on your own account, surely,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°for a man is
above that sort of thing?¡±

¡°Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,¡± said the major with a smile
and a shake of the head.

¡°But for the sake of the mother?¡± said the count.

¡°Yes, for the mother¡¯s sake¡ªhis poor mother!¡± cried the major, taking a
third biscuit.

¡°Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,¡± said the count, pouring out
for him a second glass of Alicante; ¡°your emotion has quite overcome
you.¡±

¡°His poor mother,¡± murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal gland
in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear.

¡°She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she
not?¡±

¡°She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.¡±

¡°And her name was¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Do you desire to know her name¡ª¡ª?¡±

¡°Oh,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°it would be quite superfluous for you to tell
me, for I already know it.¡±

¡°The count knows everything,¡± said the Italian, bowing.

¡°Oliva Corsinari, was it not?¡±

¡°Oliva Corsinari!¡±

¡°A marchioness?¡±

¡°A marchioness!¡±

¡°And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
family?¡±

¡°Yes, that was the way it ended.¡±

¡°And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?¡± said Monte
Cristo.

¡°What papers?¡±

¡°The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the register
of your child¡¯s birth.¡±

¡°The register of my child¡¯s birth?¡±

¡°The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti¡ªof your son; is not his
name Andrea?¡±

¡°I believe so,¡± said the major.

¡°What? You believe so?¡±

¡°I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a
time.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°you have all the documents with you?¡±

¡°Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to
come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.¡±

¡°That is unfortunate,¡± returned Monte Cristo.

¡°Were they, then, so necessary?¡±

¡°They were indispensable.¡±

The major passed his hand across his brow. ¡°Ah, perbacco, indispensable,
were they?¡±

¡°Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the
validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?¡±

¡°True,¡± said the major, ¡°there might be doubts raised.¡±

¡°In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.¡±

¡°It would be fatal to his interests.¡±

¡°It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.¡±

¡°O peccato!¡±

¡°You must know that in France they are very particular on these points;
it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, ¡®We love
each other, and want you to marry us.¡¯ Marriage is a civil affair in
France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers
which undeniably establish your identity.¡±

¡°That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.¡±

¡°Fortunately, I have them, though,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°You?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You have them?¡±

¡°I have them.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed?¡± said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey
frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his
forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000
francs¡ª¡°ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really
is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.¡±

¡°I do not at all wonder at it¡ªone cannot think of everything; but,
happily, the Abb¨¦ Busoni thought for you.¡±

¡°He is an excellent person.¡±

¡°He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.¡±

¡°He is an admirable man,¡± said the major; ¡°and he sent them to you?¡±

¡°Here they are.¡±

The major clasped his hands in token of admiration.

¡°You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-
Cattini; here is the priest¡¯s certificate.¡±

¡°Yes indeed, there it is truly,¡± said the Italian, looking on with
astonishment.

¡°And here is Andrea Cavalcanti¡¯s baptismal register, given by the cur¨¦
of Saravezza.¡±

¡°All quite correct.¡±

¡°Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give them
to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.¡±

¡°I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well, and if he were to lose them?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°In that case,¡± replied the major, ¡°it would be necessary to write to
the cur¨¦ for duplicates, and it would be some time before they could be
obtained.¡±

¡°It would be a difficult matter to arrange,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Almost an impossibility,¡± replied the major.

¡°I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.¡±

¡°I regard them as invaluable.¡±

¡°Now,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°as to the mother of the young man¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°As to the mother of the young man¡ª¡ª¡± repeated the Italian, with
anxiety.

¡°As regards the Marchesa Corsinari¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Really,¡± said the major, ¡°difficulties seem to thicken upon us; will
she be wanted in any way?¡±

¡°No, sir,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°besides, has she not¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes, sir,¡± said the major, ¡°she has¡ª¡ª¡±

30127m


¡°Paid the last debt of nature?¡±

¡°Alas, yes,¡± returned the Italian.

¡°I knew that,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°she has been dead these ten years.¡±

¡°And I am still mourning her loss,¡± exclaimed the major, drawing from
his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the left
and then the right eye.

¡°What would you have?¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°we are all mortal. Now, you
understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to
tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for
fifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are not at all in
vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed. You sent him
for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you wish
him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is the reason
which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived since
the death of your wife. That will be sufficient.¡±

¡°You think so?¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

¡°Very well, then.¡±

¡°If they should hear of the separation¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Ah, yes; what could I say?¡±

¡°That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°By the Corsinari?¡±

¡°Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might
become extinct.¡±

¡°That is reasonable, since he is an only son.¡±

¡°Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
remembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I
was preparing a surprise for you?¡±

¡°An agreeable one?¡± asked the Italian.

¡°Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
heart.¡±

¡°Hum!¡± said the major.

¡°Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was
here.¡±

¡°That who was here?¡±

¡°Your child¡ªyour son¡ªyour Andrea!¡±

¡°I did guess it,¡± replied the major with the greatest possible coolness.
¡°Then he is here?¡±

¡°He is,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°when the valet de chambre came in just now,
he told me of his arrival.¡±

¡°Ah, very well, very well,¡± said the major, clutching the buttons of his
coat at each exclamation.

¡°My dear sir,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°I understand your emotion; you must
have time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare
the young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is
not less impatient for it than yourself.¡±

¡°I should quite imagine that to be the case,¡± said Cavalcanti.

¡°Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.¡±

¡°You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to
present him to me yourself?¡±

¡°No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview will
be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of nature
should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by this
door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion¡ªa little too fair,
perhaps¡ªpleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for yourself.¡±

¡°By the way,¡± said the major, ¡°you know I have only the 2,000 francs
which the Abb¨¦ Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling
expenses, and¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.
Well, here are 8,000 francs on account.¡±

The major¡¯s eyes sparkled brilliantly.

¡°It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Does your excellency wish for a receipt?¡± said the major, at the same
time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.

¡°For what?¡± said the count.

¡°I thought you might want it to show the Abb¨¦ Busoni.¡±

¡°Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a
receipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I
think, quite unnecessary.¡±

¡°Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.¡±

¡°One word more,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Say on.¡±

¡°You will permit me to make one remark?¡±

¡°Certainly; pray do so.¡±

¡°Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.¡±

¡°Indeed,¡± said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete
satisfaction.

¡°Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant in
itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.¡±

¡°That¡¯s unfortunate.¡±

¡°Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can
easily resume it when you leave Paris.¡±

¡°But what shall I wear?¡±

¡°What you find in your trunks.¡±

¡°In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.¡±

¡°I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring
one¡¯s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to
march with as little baggage as possible.¡±

¡°That is just the case¡ªprecisely so.¡±

¡°But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your
luggage on before you. It has arrived at the H?tel des Princes, Rue de
Richelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.¡±

¡°Then, in these trunks¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all
you are likely to need,¡ªyour plain clothes and your uniform. On grand
occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do not
forget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet always
wear them, for all that.¡±

¡°Very well, very well,¡± said the major, who was in ecstasy at the
attention paid him by the count.

¡°Now,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°that you have fortified yourself against all
painful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M. Cavalcanti, to meet
your lost Andrea.¡±

Saying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared behind the tapestry,
leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful
reception which he had received at the hands of the count.






Chapter 56. Andrea Cavalcanti

The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin
had designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of
graceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab about
half an hour previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty in
recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance.
He was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red beard, black
eyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so particularly
described to him. When the count entered the room the young man was
carelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the gold-headed
cane which he held in his hand. On perceiving the count he rose quickly.

¡°The Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?¡± said he.

¡°Yes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea
Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°Count Andrea Cavalcanti,¡± repeated the young man, accompanying his
words with a bow.

¡°You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are you
not?¡± said the count.

¡°I did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so strange.¡±

¡°The letter signed ¡®Sinbad the Sailor,¡¯ is it not?¡±

¡°Exactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception
of the one celebrated in the Thousand and One Nights¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is a
very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name is
Lord Wilmore.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,¡± said
Andrea. ¡°He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met¡ªat¡ªah¡ªyes, indeed.
Well, monsieur, I am at your service.¡±

¡°If what you say be true,¡± replied the count, smiling, ¡°perhaps you will
be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family?¡±

¡°Certainly, I will do so,¡± said the young man, with a quickness which
gave proof of his ready invention. ¡°I am (as you have said) the Count
Andrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of
the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence.
Our family, although still rich (for my father¡¯s income amounts to half
a million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I myself was, at the
age of five years, taken away by the treachery of my tutor, so that for
fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence. Since I have
arrived at years of discretion and become my own master, I have been
constantly seeking him, but all in vain. At length I received this
letter from your friend, which states that my father is in Paris, and
authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him.¡±

¡°Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,¡± said
Monte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; ¡°and
you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend
Sinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.¡±

The count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not
once lost sight of the expression of the young man¡¯s countenance; he had
admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice; but at
these words, so natural in themselves, ¡°Your father is indeed here, and
is seeking you,¡± young Andrea started, and exclaimed, ¡°My father? Is my
father here?¡±

¡°Most undoubtedly,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°your father, Major Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti.¡± The expression of terror which, for the moment, had
overspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared.

¡°Ah, yes, that is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And
you really mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?¡±

¡°Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the
quick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might
furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he
one day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now
offered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be
found, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of ransom.
Your father did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent to the
frontier of Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were in the
south of France, I think?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, ¡°I was in the south of
France.¡±

¡°A carriage was to await you at Nice?¡±

¡°Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to
Turin, from Turin to Chamb¨¦ry, from Chamb¨¦ry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and
from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.¡±

30133m


¡°Indeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road, for it
is exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we have
been able to trace your journey to this place.¡±

¡°But,¡± said Andrea, ¡°if my father had met me, I doubt if he would have
recognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me.¡±

¡°Oh, the voice of nature,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°True,¡± interrupted the young man, ¡°I had not looked upon it in that
light.¡±

¡°Now,¡± replied Monte Cristo ¡°there is only one source of uneasiness left
in your father¡¯s mind, which is this¡ªhe is anxious to know how you have
been employed during your long absence from him, how you have been
treated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves
towards you with all the deference due to your rank. Finally, he is
anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral
influence to which you have been exposed, and which is infinitely more
to be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to discover if the
fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by
want of culture; and, in short, whether you consider yourself capable of
resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank
entitles you.¡±

¡°Sir!¡± exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, ¡°I hope no false
report¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the
philanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but
do not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have been
interesting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the
position which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until he
found him. He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is here
now; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave me a
few other instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite aware
that my friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as rich as a
gold mine, consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities without any
fear of their ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to his
instructions. Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I am
about to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron. I
would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to
you¡ªmisfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree
diminish my regard for you¡ªI would wish to know if they have not, in
some measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which
your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure?¡±

¡°Sir,¡± returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, ¡°make your
mind easy on this score. Those who took me from my father, and who
always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original
proprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make the
most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in possession of
all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to increase the value, if
possible. I have, therefore, received a very good education, and have
been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in
Asia Minor, whose masters made them grammarians, doctors, and
philosophers, in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman
market.¡±

Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had not
expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti.

¡°Besides,¡± continued the young man, ¡°if there did appear some defect in
education, or offence against the established forms of etiquette, I
suppose it would be excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which
accompanied my birth, and followed me through my youth.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, ¡°you will do as you
please, count, for you are the master of your own actions, and are the
person most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I would not
divulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a romance, and
the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely
mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they be
gilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to
represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited your
touching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed
unlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found, but
you would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a
mushroom in the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is
not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the
subject of unpleasant remark.¡±

¡°I agree with you, monsieur,¡± said the young man, turning pale, and, in
spite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his
companion, ¡°such consequences would be extremely unpleasant.¡±

¡°Nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil,¡± said Monte Cristo,
¡°for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another. You
must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man
of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must
form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice
which may attach to the obscurity of your former life.¡±

Andrea visibly changed countenance.

¡°I would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser,¡± said Monte
Cristo, ¡°did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a
sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in
departing from this rule, I should (as the actors say) be playing a part
quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run the risk of being
hissed, which would be an act of folly.¡±

¡°However, your excellency,¡± said Andrea, ¡°in consideration of Lord
Wilmore, by whom I was recommended to you¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes, certainly,¡± interrupted Monte Cristo; ¡°but Lord Wilmore did not
omit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was
rather a stormy one. Ah,¡± said the count, watching Andrea¡¯s countenance,
¡°I do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely to avoid that
necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca. You shall soon see
him. He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and he is
disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has been
for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be pardoned.
We are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In short, you will
find your father a very presentable person, I assure you.¡±

¡°Ah, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were
separated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides,
you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all
defects.¡±

¡°He is a millionaire¡ªhis income is 500,000 francs.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said the young man, with anxiety, ¡°I shall be sure to be placed
in an agreeable position.¡±

¡°One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an
income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in
Paris.¡±

¡°Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there.¡±

¡°You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; ¡®man proposes, and God
disposes.¡¯¡± Andrea sighed.

¡°But,¡± said he, ¡°so long as I do remain in Paris, and nothing forces me
to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum
you just now mentioned to me?¡±

¡°You may.¡±

¡°Shall I receive it from my father?¡± asked Andrea, with some uneasiness.

¡°Yes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord Wilmore
will be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your
father, opened an account of 5,000 francs a month at M. Danglars¡¯, which
is one of the safest banks in Paris.¡±

¡°And does my father mean to remain long in Paris?¡± asked Andrea.

¡°Only a few days,¡± replied Monte Cristo. ¡°His service does not allow him
to absent himself more than two or three weeks together.¡±

¡°Ah, my dear father!¡± exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea
of his speedy departure.

¡°Therefore,¡± said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his
meaning¡ª¡°therefore I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure
of your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father?¡±

¡°I hope you do not doubt it.¡±

30137m


¡°Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find
your father awaiting you.¡±

Andrea made a low bow to the count, and entered the adjoining room.
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared, and then touched a spring
in a panel made to look like a picture, which, in sliding partly from
the frame, discovered to view a small opening, so cleverly contrived
that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied
by Cavalcanti and Andrea. The young man closed the door behind him, and
advanced towards the major, who had risen when he heard steps
approaching him.

¡°Ah, my dear father!¡± said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the
count might hear him in the next room, ¡°is it really you?¡±

¡°How do you do, my dear son?¡± said the major gravely.

¡°After so many years of painful separation,¡± said Andrea, in the same
tone of voice, and glancing towards the door, ¡°what a happiness it is to
meet again!¡±

¡°Indeed it is, after so long a separation.¡±

¡°Will you not embrace me, sir?¡± said Andrea.

30139m


¡°If you wish it, my son,¡± said the major; and the two men embraced each
other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each
rested his head on the other¡¯s shoulder.

¡°Then we are once more reunited?¡± said Andrea.

¡°Once more,¡± replied the major.

¡°Never more to be separated?¡±

¡°Why, as to that¡ªI think, my dear son, you must be by this time so
accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country.¡±

¡°The fact is,¡± said the young man, ¡°that I should be exceedingly grieved
to leave it.¡±

¡°As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca; therefore
I shall return to Italy as soon as I can.¡±

¡°But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me in
possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my
descent.¡±

¡°Certainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much
trouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,
and if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few
remaining years of my life.¡±

¡°Where are these papers, then?¡±

¡°Here they are.¡±

Andrea seized the certificate of his father¡¯s marriage and his own
baptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness
which might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a
facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and
with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the
contents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression
of pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a
most peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan:

¡°Then there is no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to
the galleys?¡±

The major drew himself up to his full height.

¡°Why?¡ªwhat do you mean by that question?¡±

¡°I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with
impunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a
piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to
Toulon for five years, for change of air.¡±

¡°Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?¡± said the major,
endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest
majesty.

¡°My dear M. Cavalcanti,¡± said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a
confidential manner, ¡°how much are you paid for being my father?¡±

The major was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a low voice:

¡°Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me
50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand
that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.¡±

The major looked anxiously around him.

¡°Make yourself easy, we are quite alone,¡± said Andrea; ¡°besides, we are
conversing in Italian.¡±

¡°Well, then,¡± replied the major, ¡°they paid me 50,000 francs down.¡±

¡°Monsieur Cavalcanti,¡± said Andrea, ¡°do you believe in fairy tales?¡±

¡°I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith
in them.¡±

¡°You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some
proofs of their truth?¡± The major drew from his pocket a handful of
gold.

¡°Most palpable proofs,¡± said he, ¡°as you may perceive.¡±

¡°You think, then, that I may rely on the count¡¯s promises?¡±

¡°Certainly I do.¡±

¡°You are sure he will keep his word with me?¡±

¡°To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to play
our respective parts. I, as a tender father¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from
you.¡±

¡°Whom do you mean by they?¡±

¡°Ma foi, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the
letter; you received one, did you not?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°From whom?¡±

¡°From a certain Abb¨¦ Busoni.¡±

¡°Have you any knowledge of him?¡±

¡°No, I have never seen him.¡±

¡°What did he say in the letter?¡±

¡°You will promise not to betray me?¡±

¡°Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.¡±

¡°Then read for yourself;¡± and the major gave a letter into the young
man¡¯s hand. Andrea read in a low voice:

¡°¡®You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to become
rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris, and demand
of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, No. 30, the son
whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you at
five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that
you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you
will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at
Signor Gozzi¡¯s; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte
Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember to go to
the count on the 26th May at seven o¡¯clock in the evening.

¡°(Signed) ¡®Abb¨¦ Busoni.¡¯¡±

¡°It is the same.¡±

¡°What do you mean?¡± said the major.

¡°I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect.¡±

¡°You?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°From the Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°From whom, then?¡±

¡°From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad
the Sailor.¡±

¡°And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡±

¡°You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.¡±

¡°You have seen him, then?¡±

¡°Yes, once.¡±

¡°Where?¡±

¡°Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you as
wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.¡±

¡°And what did the letter contain?¡±

¡°Read it.¡±

¡°¡®You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy. Do you
wish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?¡¯¡±

¡°Parbleu!¡± said the young man; ¡°was it possible there could be two
answers to such a question?¡±

¡°¡®Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de
G¨ºnes, as you enter Nice; pass through Turin, Chamb¨¦ry, and Pont-de-
Beauvoisin. Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es,
on the 26th of May, at seven o¡¯clock in the evening, and demand of him
your father. You are the son of the Marchese Cavalcanti and the Marchesa
Oliva Corsinari. The marquis will give you some papers which will
certify this fact, and authorize you to appear under that name in the
Parisian world. As to your rank, an annual income of 50,000 livres will
enable you to support it admirably. I enclose a draft for 5,000 livres,
payable on M. Ferrea, banker at Nice, and also a letter of introduction
to the Count of Monte Cristo, whom I have directed to supply all your
wants.

¡°¡®Sinbad the Sailor.¡¯¡±

¡°Humph,¡± said the major; ¡°very good. You have seen the count, you say?¡±

¡°I have only just left him.¡±

¡°And has he conformed to all that the letter specified?¡±

¡°He has.¡±

¡°Do you understand it?¡±

¡°Not in the least.¡±

¡°There is a dupe somewhere.¡±

¡°At all events, it is neither you nor I.¡±

¡°Certainly not.¡±

¡°Well, then¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?¡±

¡°No; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and
consent to be blindfolded.¡±

¡°Ah, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to admiration.¡±

¡°I never once doubted your doing so.¡± Monte Cristo chose this moment for
re-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his footsteps, the
two men threw themselves in each other¡¯s arms, and while they were in
the midst of this embrace, the count entered.

¡°Well, marquis,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°you appear to be in no way
disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you.¡±

¡°Ah, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight.¡±

¡°And what are your feelings?¡± said Monte Cristo, turning to the young
man.

¡°As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.¡±

¡°Happy father, happy son!¡± said the count.

¡°There is only one thing which grieves me,¡± observed the major, ¡°and
that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.¡±

¡°Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have had
the honor of presenting you to some of my friends.¡±

¡°I am at your service, sir,¡± replied the major.

¡°Now, sir,¡± said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, ¡°make your
confession.¡±

¡°To whom?¡±

¡°Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.¡±

¡°Ma foi! monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.¡±

¡°Do you hear what he says, major?¡±

¡°Certainly I do.¡±

¡°But do you understand?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°Your son says he requires money.¡±

¡°Well, what would you have me do?¡± said the major.

¡°You should furnish him with some of course,¡± replied Monte Cristo.

¡°I?¡±

¡°Yes, you,¡± said the count, at the same time advancing towards Andrea,
and slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young man¡¯s hand.

¡°What is this?¡±

¡°It is from your father.¡±

¡°From my father?¡±

¡°Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well, then,
he deputes me to give you this.¡±

¡°Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?¡±

¡°No, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris.¡±

¡°Ah, how good my dear father is!¡±

¡°Silence,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°he does not wish you to know that it
comes from him.¡±

¡°I fully appreciate his delicacy,¡± said Andrea, cramming the notes
hastily into his pocket.

¡°And now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?¡±
asked Cavalcanti.

¡°Ah,¡± said Andrea, ¡°when may we hope for that pleasure?¡±

¡°On Saturday, if you will¡ªYes.¡ªLet me see¡ªSaturday¡ªI am to dine at my
country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.
Several persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your banker.
I will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should know
you, as he is to pay your money.¡±

¡°Full dress?¡± said the major, half aloud.

¡°Oh, yes, certainly,¡± said the count; ¡°uniform, cross, knee-breeches.¡±

¡°And how shall I be dressed?¡± demanded Andrea.

30145m


¡°Oh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white waistcoat,
either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin or V¨¦ronique
for your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do not know
their address. The less pretension there is in your attire, the better
will be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to buy any
horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go to
Baptiste for it.¡±

¡°At what hour shall we come?¡± asked the young man.

¡°About half-past six.¡±

¡°We will be with you at that time,¡± said the major. The two Cavalcanti
bowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to the window,
and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm.

¡°There go two miscreants;¡± said he, ¡°it is a pity they are not really
related!¡± Then, after an instant of gloomy reflection, ¡°Come, I will go
to see the Morrels,¡± said he; ¡°I think that disgust is even more
sickening than hatred.¡±

Chapter 57. In the Lucern Patch

Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure
surrounding M. de Villefort¡¯s house, and, behind the gate, half screened
from view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their
luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance. This
time Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was intently watching for a
shadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting with anxiety the sound of
a light step on the gravel walk.

At length, the long-desired sound was heard, and instead of one figure,
as he had expected, he perceived that two were approaching him. The
delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eug¨¦nie,
which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was
expected. That she might not appear to fail in her promise to
Maximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take
a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay, which was
doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by any neglect
on her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover,
quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily
placed, and he was comforted. Besides, although she avoided coming
within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could
see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she managed,
unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at the young
man, which seemed to say, ¡°Have patience! You see it is not my fault.¡±

And Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally contrasting
the two girls,¡ªone fair, with soft languishing eyes, a figure gracefully
bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette, with a fierce and
haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It is unnecessary to
state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did not suffer by
the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went away, and Maximilian
understood that Mademoiselle Danglars¡¯ visit had at last come to an end.
In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone. For fear that
anyone should be observing her return, she walked slowly; and instead of
immediately directing her steps towards the gate, she seated herself on
a bench, and, carefully casting her eyes around, to convince herself
that she was not watched, she presently arose, and proceeded quickly to
join Maximilian.

¡°Good-evening, Valentine,¡± said a well-known voice.

¡°Good-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw
the cause of my delay.¡±

¡°Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you were
so intimate with her.¡±

¡°Who told you we were intimate, Maximilian?¡±

¡°No one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you walked
and talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls
telling your secrets to each other.¡±

¡°We were having a confidential conversation,¡± returned Valentine; ¡°she
was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and
I, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to
think of marrying M. d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

¡°Dear Valentine!¡±

¡°That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed
between me and Eug¨¦nie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not love,
my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were
fixed.¡±

¡°Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality which
can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable charm
which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the
fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.¡±

¡°It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.¡±

¡°No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing you
both when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at
all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot
understand how any man can really love her.¡±

¡°The fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the
effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison.¡±

¡°No; but tell me¡ªit is a question of simple curiosity, and which was
suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle
Danglars¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say. It
only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,¡±
interrupted Valentine.

¡°You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each
other.¡±

¡°If we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence of
excitement. But return to your question.¡±

30151m


¡°Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf
on account of loving another?¡±

¡°I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eug¨¦nie.¡±

¡°Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly
intimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see
you are smiling.¡±

¡°If you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the wooden
partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight
security.¡±

¡°Come, what did she say?¡±

¡°She told me that she loved no one,¡± said Valentine; ¡°that she disliked
the idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an
independent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father
might lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her
friend, Mademoiselle Louise d¡¯Armilly.¡±

¡°Ah, you see¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well, what does that prove?¡± asked Valentine.

¡°Nothing,¡± replied Maximilian.

¡°Then why did you smile?¡±

¡°Why, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,
Valentine.¡±

¡°Do you want me to go away?¡±

¡°Ah, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which I
wish to speak.¡±

¡°True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass
together.¡±

¡°Ma foi!¡± said Maximilian, in consternation.

¡°Yes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I cause
you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I
bitterly reproach myself, I assure you.¡±

¡°Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and
feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five
minutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also a
deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts,
harmonizing as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to
separate us at last.¡±

¡°Those are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,
Maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.¡±

¡°But why must you leave me so soon?¡±

¡°I do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort
sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to make on which
a part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune, I am already
too rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will leave me in
peace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were poor, would you
not, Maximilian?¡±

¡°Oh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches or
poverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one
could deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication may
relate to your marriage?¡±

¡°I do not think that is the case.¡±

¡°However it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you
that, as long as I live, I shall never love anyone else!¡±

¡°Do you think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian?¡±

¡°Pardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you
that I met M. de Morcerf the other day.¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know.¡±

¡°What then?¡±

¡°Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his
immediate return.¡± Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against
the gate.

¡°Ah heavens, if it were that! But no, the communication would not come
through Madame de Villefort.¡±

¡°Why not?¡±

¡°Because¡ªI scarcely know why¡ªbut it has appeared as if Madame de
Villefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not choose
openly to oppose it.¡±

¡°Is it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort.¡±

¡°Do not be in such a hurry to do that,¡± said Valentine, with a sad
smile.

¡°If she objects to your marrying M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, she would be all the more
likely to listen to any other proposition.¡±

¡°No, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects,
it is marriage itself.¡±

¡°Marriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry
herself?¡±

¡°You do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of
retiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks
which she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the
proposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was
only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the
project. You can form no idea of the expression of that old man¡¯s eye
when he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and, I
had almost said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my
resolution, I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on
me, and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his
lifeless cheeks. Ah, Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment, such
remorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, I
exclaimed,¡ª¡®Forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may
do what they will with me, I will never leave you.¡¯ When I had ceased
speaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering
a word. Ah, Maximilian, I may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my
grandfather¡¯s look at that moment would more than compensate for all.¡±

¡°Dear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not know
what I¡ªsabring right and left among the Bedouins¡ªcan have done to merit
your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, Heaven took into
consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But
tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining
unmarried?¡±

¡°Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian¡ªtoo rich? I
possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and
my grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-M¨¦ran, will leave me
as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My
brother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore,
be poor in comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this
fortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his
son.¡±

¡°Ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should
be so avaricious.¡±

¡°It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you
regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of
maternal love.¡±

¡°But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your
fortune to her son?¡±

¡°How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always
professes to be so entirely disinterested?¡±

¡°Valentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of something
sacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of respect, and
hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being, not even my
sister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit me to make
a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?¡±

Valentine started. ¡°A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I
tremble to give my permission.¡±

¡°Listen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden
and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had
been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first
time you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall
the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and
failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must
have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to
the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the
past?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first
saw that extraordinary man.¡±

¡°Extraordinary, did you say?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You have known him for some time, then?¡±

¡°Scarcely longer than eight or ten days.¡±

¡°And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or
ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the
title of friend.¡±

¡°Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can
never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of
my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be
associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,
and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to
come, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according
to his own will.¡±

¡°He must be a prophet, then,¡± said Valentine, smiling.

¡°Indeed,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°I have often been almost tempted to
attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a wonderful
power of foretelling any future good.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Valentine in a mournful tone, ¡°do let me see this man,
Maximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to
make amends for all I have suffered.¡±

¡°My poor girl, you know him already.¡±

¡°I know him?¡±

¡°Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.¡±

¡°The Count of Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°The same.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± cried Valentine, ¡°he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort
ever to be mine.¡±

¡°The friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine, you
are mistaken?¡±

¡°No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household is
almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the
epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never
before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by
Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count¡¯s large black eyes,
runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he
is sure to find some delightful present,¡ªM. de Monte Cristo appears to
exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the
members of our family.¡±

¡°If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt, or
at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He meets
Albert de Morcerf in Italy¡ªit is to rescue him from the hands of the
banditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars¡ªit is that he may
give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his
door¡ªit is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This man
evidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards men
and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater
magnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget
it ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever
looked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you
will be happy.¡±

¡°Me?¡± said the young girl, ¡°he never even glances at me; on the
contrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid
me. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural
penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have
perceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me sad
and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and
since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart
with one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; how
do you know that he does? All would pay deference to an officer like
you, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think they may
crush a poor weeping girl with impunity.¡±

¡°Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.¡±

¡°If it were otherwise¡ªif he treated me diplomatically¡ªthat is to say,
like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in
the house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its
occupants¡ªhe would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the
smile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy, he
understood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no
attention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please Madame
de Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in
his power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any
reason. Ah, forgive me,¡± said Valentine, perceiving the effect which her
words were producing on Maximilian: ¡°I have done wrong, for I have given
utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know
existed in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you speak, or
that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been
productive of evil rather than good.¡±

¡°Well, Valentine,¡± said Morrel with a sigh, ¡°we will not discuss the
matter further. I will not make a confidant of him.¡±

¡°Alas!¡± said Valentine, ¡°I see that I have given you pain. I can only
say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you. But, indeed, I am
not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me what this Count
of Monte Cristo has done for you.¡±

30157m


¡°I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say
that the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I have
already told you, I have an instinctive affection for him, the source of
which I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No; he
warms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see you¡ªnothing
more. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No; its odor
charms one of my senses¡ªthat is all I can say when I am asked why I
praise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his
for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be
something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship.
In his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret thoughts, I
find a relation to my own. You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you
that, ever since I have known this man, I have involuntarily entertained
the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from
him. However, I have managed to live thirty years without this
protection, you will say; but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my
meaning. He invited me to dine with him on Saturday, which was a very
natural thing for him to do. Well, what have I learned since? That your
mother and M. de Villefort are both coming to this dinner. I shall meet
them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the
interview? This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of
circumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some hidden plot in the
arrangement¡ªsomething, in fact, more than is apparent on a casual view
of the subject. I believe that this singular man, who appears to fathom
the motives of everyone, has purposely arranged for me to meet M. and
Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I confess, I have gone so far as to
try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of
our love.¡±

¡°My good friend,¡± said Valentine, ¡°I should take you for a visionary,
and should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk in
a strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see anything more
than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a little. My
father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point of
refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is
burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own
house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father
to accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,¡ªthere is no
one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather,
who is little better than a corpse¡ªno support to cling to but my mother
in heaven!¡±

¡°I see that you are right, logically speaking,¡± said Maximilian; ¡°but
the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince
me today.¡±

¡°I feel the same as regards yourself.¡± said Valentine; ¡°and I own that,
if you have no stronger proof to give me¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I have another,¡± replied Maximilian; ¡°but I fear you will deem it even
more absurd than the first.¡±

¡°So much the worse,¡± said Valentine, smiling.

¡°It is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service
have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for
I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed
me to move at once either to the right or to the left, in order to
escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side, while it
left me unharmed.¡±

¡°Dear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers
for your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but for
you.¡±

30159m


¡°Yes, since you have known me,¡± said Morrel, smiling; ¡°but that cannot
apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.¡±

¡°You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but
let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.¡±

¡°Well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new
horse which I rode here.¡±

¡°Ah! what a beautiful creature!¡± cried Valentine; ¡°why did you not bring
him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?¡±

¡°He is, as you see, a very valuable animal,¡± said Maximilian. ¡°You know
that my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man
of moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealer¡¯s, where I saw
this magnificent horse, which I have named M¨¦d¨¦ah. I asked the price;
they told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give it
up, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart,
for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his head
against me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most delightful
way imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with him. The same
evening some friends of mine visited me,¡ªM. de Chateau-Renaud, M.
Debray, and five or six other choice spirits, whom you do not know, even
by name. They proposed a game of bouillotte. I never play, for I am not
rich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently poor to desire to gain.
But I was at my own house, you understand, so there was nothing to be
done but to send for the cards, which I did.

¡°Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived. He
took his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am almost ashamed
to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated at midnight.
I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and drove to the
horse dealer¡¯s. Feverish and excited, I rang at the door. The person who
opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed at once to the
stable. M¨¦d¨¦ah was standing at the rack, eating his hay. I immediately
put on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he lent himself with
the best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs into the hands
of the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing
the night in riding in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es. As I rode by the count¡¯s
house I perceived a light in one of the windows, and fancied I saw the
shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain. Now, Valentine, I firmly
believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse, and that he lost
expressly to give me the means of procuring him.¡±

¡°My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love even
me long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry
and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common, every-
day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do you
hear?¡±

¡°Ah, Valentine,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°give me but one finger through this
opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I
may have the happiness of kissing it.¡±

¡°Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two
shadows.¡±

¡°As you will, Valentine.¡±

¡°Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?¡±

¡°Oh, yes!¡±

Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her
whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of delight,
and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and
imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was then
immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards
the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations.






Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort

We will now relate what was passing in the house of the king¡¯s attorney
after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the
time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have
just detailed.

M. de Villefort entered his father¡¯s room, followed by Madame de
Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and speaking
to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years in his
service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.

M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in
which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way
drawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which
reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,
which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room
and everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although
almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick
and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious
courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official
character.

Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two
solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit
for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of
these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still
occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his inner
life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by
night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells
beyond the silence and obscurity.

Noirtier¡¯s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders; while
in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as it often
happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others, all
the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were formerly
diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of the arm,
the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were wanting, the
speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded with it; it was the medium
through which his thanks were conveyed. In short, his whole appearance
produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes, and
nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger
or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the rest of the rigid
and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the power of
participation. Three persons only could understand this language of the
poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and the old servant of
whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw his father but seldom,
and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he never took any pains to
please or gratify him when he was there, all the old man¡¯s happiness was
centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by means of her love, her
patience, and her devotion, had learned to read in Noirtier¡¯s look all
the varied feelings which were passing in his mind. To this dumb
language, which was so unintelligible to others, she answered by
throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance, and in
this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl
and the helpless invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living
one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and
penetration, united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by
a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses.

Valentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his
thoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring and
devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions of
every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,
thinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.

As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for
five-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was
seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt
was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.

Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in
order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was
about to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man¡¯s
vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only
indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing. He therefore
allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois, and after
having seated himself at his father¡¯s right hand, while Madame de
Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:

¡°I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come
with us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one
which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.¡±

Noirtier¡¯s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,
while, on the contrary, Villefort¡¯s eye was endeavoring to penetrate
into the inmost recesses of the old man¡¯s heart.

¡°This communication,¡± continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive
tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, ¡°will, we are
sure, meet with your approbation.¡±

The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which
prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which
were passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.

¡°Sir,¡± resumed Villefort, ¡°we are thinking of marrying Valentine.¡± Had
the old man¡¯s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less
emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. ¡°The marriage will
take place in less than three months,¡± said Villefort.

Noirtier¡¯s eye still retained its inanimate expression.

Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:

¡°We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have
always entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only
now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is
destined. It is one of the most desirable connections which could
possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and
every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely
happy,¡ªhis name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. It is M.
Franz de Quesnel, Baron d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

While his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old
man¡¯s countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of
Franz, the pupil of M. Noirtier¡¯s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids
trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an
individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de
Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred
which had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d¡¯¨¦pinay,
well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had
produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed
the narrative begun by his wife.

¡°Sir,¡± said he, ¡°you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her
nineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no time
in forming a suitable alliance. Nevertheless, you have not been
forgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that
Valentine¡¯s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for
that might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should
live with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each
other, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly
the same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead
of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you
two children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.¡±

30165m


Noirtier¡¯s look was furious; it was very evident that something
desperate was passing in the old man¡¯s mind, for a cry of anger and
grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,
appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple
with the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, ¡°It is
very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.¡± He then returned to his
place, but did not sit down.

¡°This marriage,¡± added Madame de Villefort, ¡°is quite agreeable to the
wishes of M. d¡¯¨¦pinay and his family; besides, he had no relations
nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and
his father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he was
but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to
choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any
other authority but that of his own will.¡±

¡°That assassination was a mysterious affair,¡± said Villefort, ¡°and the
perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has
fallen on the head of more than one person.¡±

Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.

¡°Now,¡± continued Villefort, ¡°those to whom the guilt really belongs, by
whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may
probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would
rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace-
offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly
destroyed.¡± Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than
could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered
frame.

¡°Yes, I understand,¡± was the reply contained in his look; and this look
expressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound contempt.
Villefort fully understood his father¡¯s meaning, and answered by a
slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to take
leave.

¡°Now sir,¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°I must bid you farewell. Would you
like me to send Edward to you for a short time?¡±

It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by
closing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he
had some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he
wanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the
left. At Madame de Villefort¡¯s proposition he instantly winked his eyes.

Provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, ¡°Then shall I
send Valentine to you?¡± The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby
intimating that such was his wish.

M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that
Valentine should be summoned to her grandfather¡¯s presence, and feeling
sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed
spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still heightened by
emotion, entered the room just after her parents had quitted it. One
look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering, and
that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to
her.

¡°Dear grandpapa,¡± cried she, ¡°what has happened? They have vexed you,
and you are angry?¡±

The paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.

¡°Who has displeased you? Is it my father?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Madame de Villefort?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Me?¡± The former sign was repeated.

¡°Are you displeased with me?¡± cried Valentine in astonishment. M.
Noirtier again closed his eyes.

¡°And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with
me?¡± cried Valentine.

There was no answer, and she continued:

¡°I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against
me?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said the old man¡¯s look, with eagerness.

¡°Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa¡ªAh¡ªM. and Madame de
Villefort have just left this room, have they not?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was
it then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of
making my peace with you?¡±

¡°No, no,¡± said Noirtier¡¯s look.

¡°Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?¡± and she again tried to
think what it could be.

¡°Ah, I know,¡± said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old
man. ¡°They have been speaking of my marriage,¡ªhave they not?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied the angry look.

¡°I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the
subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the
matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They did
not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered them
by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.
Pray forgive me.¡±

But there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say
was, ¡°It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.¡±

¡°What is it, then?¡± asked the young girl. ¡°Perhaps you think I shall
abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am
married?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°They told you, then, that M. d¡¯¨¦pinay consented to our all living
together?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Then why are you still vexed and grieved?¡± The old man¡¯s eyes beamed
with an expression of gentle affection.

¡°Yes, I understand,¡± said Valentine; ¡°it is because you love me.¡± The
old man assented.

¡°And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You do not like M. Franz?¡± The eyes repeated several times, ¡°No, no,
no.¡±

¡°Then you are vexed with the engagement?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, listen,¡± said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and
putting her arm round her grandfather¡¯s neck, ¡°I am vexed, too, for I do
not love M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

An expression of intense joy illumined the old man¡¯s eyes.

¡°When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you were
with me?¡± A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid. ¡°Well,¡± continued
Valentine, ¡°the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this
hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.¡± Noirtier¡¯s breathing came
thick and short.

¡°Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you could
but help me¡ªif we could both together defeat their plan! But you are
unable to oppose them,¡ªyou, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so
firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am
myself. Alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me
in the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my
joys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.
However, this is much, and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken
away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.¡±

At these words there appeared in Noirtier¡¯s eye an expression of such
deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words
there: ¡°You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.¡±

¡°Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?¡± said Valentine.

¡°Yes.¡± Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him
and Valentine when he wanted anything.

¡°What is it you want, dear grandpapa?¡± said Valentine, and she
endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to
need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated
them aloud, then,¡ªfinding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a
constant ¡°No,¡±¡ªshe said, ¡°Come, since this plan does not answer, I will
have recourse to another.¡±

She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When
she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she
had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.

¡°Ah,¡± said Valentine, ¡°the thing you desire begins with the letter N; it
is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what can you want
that begins with N? Na¡ªNe¡ªNi¡ªNo¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Yes, yes, yes,¡± said the old man¡¯s eye.

¡°Ah, it is No, then?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

Valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before
Noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the old man¡¯s eye was
thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down
the columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first
fell into this sad state, Valentine¡¯s powers of invention had been too
often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients
for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so
perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man¡¯s meaning as
quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At
the word Notary, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.

30169m


¡°Notary,¡± said she, ¡°do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?¡± The old man
again signified that it was a notary he desired.

¡°You would wish a notary to be sent for then?¡± said Valentine.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Shall my father be informed of your wish?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all you
want?¡±

¡°Yes.¡± Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur
or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier¡¯s
room.

¡°Are you satisfied now?¡± inquired Valentine.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that.¡± And the
young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de
Villefort entered, followed by Barrois.

¡°What do you want me for, sir?¡± demanded he of the paralytic.

¡°Sir,¡± said Valentine, ¡°my grandfather wishes for a notary.¡± At this
strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged
looks.

¡°Yes,¡± motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to declare that
with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who both knew what his
wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the contest.

¡°Do you wish for a notary?¡± asked Villefort.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°What to do?¡±

Noirtier made no answer.

¡°What do you want with a notary?¡± again repeated Villefort. The
invalid¡¯s eye remained fixed, by which expression he intended to
intimate that his resolution was unalterable.

¡°Is it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?¡± said
Villefort.

¡°Still,¡± said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,
¡°if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for a
notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.¡± Barrois
acknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in
any way to be contradicted.

30171m


¡°Yes, I do want a notary,¡± motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with
a look of defiance, which seemed to say, ¡°and I should like to see the
person who dares to refuse my request.¡±

¡°You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,¡± said
Villefort; ¡°but I shall explain to him your state of health, and make
excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous
one.¡±

¡°Never mind that,¡± said Barrois; ¡°I shall go and fetch a notary,
nevertheless.¡± And the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission.






Chapter 59. The Will

As soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with
a malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly
understood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became
clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and
quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself
with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a
side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she also was to
remain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned,
bringing the notary with him.

¡°Sir,¡± said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, ¡°you were
sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All his limbs have become
completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find
much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.¡±

Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so
earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.

¡°Sir,¡± said she, ¡°I perfectly understand my grandfather¡¯s meaning at all
times.¡±

¡°That is quite true,¡± said Barrois; ¡°and that is what I told the
gentleman as we walked along.¡±

¡°Permit me,¡± said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to
Valentine¡ª¡°permit me to state that the case in question is just one of
those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act
without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first thing
necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be
thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and
wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the
approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me,
on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite
useless, and cannot be legally exercised.¡±

The notary then prepared to retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph
was expressed on the lips of the procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine
with an expression so full of grief, that she arrested the departure of
the notary.

¡°Sir,¡± said she, ¡°the language which I speak with my grandfather may be
easily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it
almost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in
order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?¡±

¡°In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation
or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the
validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.¡±

¡°Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you
presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather
is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M.
Noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey
his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify ¡®yes,¡¯ and to
wink when he means ¡®no.¡¯ You now know quite enough to enable you to
converse with M. Noirtier;¡ªtry.¡±

Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it
was comprehended even by the notary himself.

¡°You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying,
sir, have you?¡± asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes.

¡°And you approve of what she said¡ªthat is to say, you declare that the
signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are
accustomed to convey your thoughts?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°It was you who sent for me?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°To make your will?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
intentions?¡± The old man winked violently.

¡°Well, sir,¡± said the young girl, ¡°do you understand now, and is your
conscience perfectly at rest on the subject?¡±

But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.

¡°Sir,¡± said he, ¡°do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a
physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment
to his mental faculties?¡±

¡°It is not exactly that, sir,¡± said the notary, ¡°which makes me uneasy,
but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as
to be able to get his answers.¡±

¡°You must see that to be an utter impossibility,¡± said Villefort.
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed
his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the
look.

¡°Sir,¡± said she, ¡°that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it
may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my
grandfather¡¯s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears
on the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and let him
tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a thought
which he was unable to make me understand.¡±

¡°No,¡± signed the old man.

¡°Let us try what we can do, then,¡± said the notary. ¡°You accept this
young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you
wish to be drawn up?¡±

Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W. At
this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to
stop.

¡°It is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,¡±
said the notary.

¡°Wait,¡± said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated,
¡°Wa¡ªWe¡ªWi¡ª¡ª¡± The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine
then took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned
over the pages.

She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the
word ¡°Will,¡± M. Noirtier¡¯s eye bade her stop.

¡°Will,¡± said the notary; ¡°it is very evident that M. Noirtier is
desirous of making his will.¡±

¡°Yes, yes, yes,¡± motioned the invalid.

¡°Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,¡± said the
astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.

¡°Yes,¡± said the procureur, ¡°and I think the will promises to be yet more
extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the
intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too
much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable
interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.¡±

¡°No, no, no,¡± replied the eye of the paralytic.

¡°What?¡± said Villefort, ¡°do you mean to say that Valentine is not
interested in your will?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and who
had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this
extraordinary and picturesque scene, ¡°what appeared so impossible to me
an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be
a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven
witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the
presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very much
more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms necessary to
be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the details, the
greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find
the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the
management of them, can doubtless give full information on the subject.
But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be contested,
I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore,
one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist
in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?¡± continued
the notary, addressing the old man.

30175m


¡°Yes,¡± looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready
interpretation of his meaning.

¡°What is he going to do?¡± thought Villefort, whose position demanded
much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father¡¯s intentions
were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but
Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master¡¯s wishes,
and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his wife to
come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in
the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived.

A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers
of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order to
give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally
couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator, the first
notary said, turning towards him:

¡°When an individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in
prejudice of some person.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you
will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own
possessions?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had the
struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it
was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had
formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a
table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the
testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have
alluded.

¡°Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?¡± asked he. Noirtier
made a sign that it did.

¡°Do you possess 400,000 francs?¡± inquired the notary. Noirtier¡¯s eye
remained immovable.

¡°500,000?¡± The same expression continued.

¡°600,000¡ª700,000¡ª800,000¡ª900,000?¡±

Noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.

¡°You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?¡± asked the notary.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°In landed property?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°In stock?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°The stock is in your own hands?¡±

The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was
something wanting which he knew where to find. The old servant left the
room, and presently returned, bringing with him a small casket.

¡°Do you permit us to open this casket?¡± asked the notary. Noirtier gave
his assent.

They opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first notary
handed over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague.

The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated.

¡°It is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still
retains its full force and vigor.¡± Then, turning towards the paralytic,
he said, ¡°You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according
to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income
of about 40,000 livres?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?¡±

¡°Oh!¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°there is not much doubt on that
subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de
Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and
has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had almost
said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she
should reap the fruit of her devotion.¡±

The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not
deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villefort¡¯s words and
manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain.

¡°Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave
these 900,000 francs?¡± demanded the notary, thinking he had only to
insert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which
it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this
singular scene.

Valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped
back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she
was crying. The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression
of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he
significantly winked his eye in token of dissent.

¡°What,¡± said the notary, ¡°do you not intend making Mademoiselle
Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°You are not making any mistake, are you?¡± said the notary; ¡°you really
mean to declare that such is not your intention?¡±

¡°No,¡± repeated Noirtier; ¡°No.¡±

Valentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so
much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but
her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her
grandfather to such an act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much
affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed:

¡°Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you
deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.¡±

¡°Ah, yes, most assuredly,¡± said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed
them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.

¡°Thank you, thank you,¡± murmured she. The old man¡¯s declaration that
Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the
hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and
said:

¡°Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to
your grandson, Edward de Villefort?¡±

The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and
terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.

¡°No?¡± said the notary; ¡°then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de
Villefort?¡±

¡°No.¡± The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and
inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort
and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.

¡°What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?¡± said Valentine; ¡°you no
longer seem to love any of us?¡±

The old man¡¯s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and
rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.

¡°Well,¡± said she; ¡°if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love to
bear upon your actions at this present moment. You know me well enough
to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune; besides,
they say I am already rich in right of my mother¡ªtoo rich, even. Explain
yourself, then.¡±

Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine¡¯s hand.

¡°My hand?¡± said she.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Her hand!¡± exclaimed everyone.

¡°Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father¡¯s mind is
really impaired,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Ah,¡± cried Valentine suddenly, ¡°I understand. It is my marriage you
mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?¡±

¡°Yes, yes, yes,¡± signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of
joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.

30179m


¡°You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?¡±

¡°Yes?¡±

¡°Really, this is too absurd,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Excuse me, sir,¡± replied the notary; ¡°on the contrary, the meaning of
M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the
train of ideas passing in his mind.¡±

¡°You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡± observed Valentine.

¡°I do not wish it,¡± said the eye of her grandfather.

¡°And you disinherit your granddaughter,¡± continued the notary, ¡°because
she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding a
consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense
gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame
de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy,
which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.

¡°But,¡± said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, ¡°I
consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in
question. I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my
daughter¡¯s hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz
d¡¯¨¦pinay¡ªand she shall marry him.¡±

Valentine sank weeping into a chair.

¡°Sir,¡± said the notary, ¡°how do you intend disposing of your fortune in
case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?¡±
The old man gave no answer.

¡°You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°In favor of some member of your family?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?¡± pursued the
notary.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°But,¡± said the notary, ¡°you are aware that the law does not allow a son
to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which
the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?¡±
Noirtier made no answer.

¡°Do you still wish to dispose of all?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°But they will contest the will after your death?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°My father knows me,¡± replied Villefort; ¡°he is quite sure that his
wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my
position I cannot plead against the poor.¡± The eye of Noirtier beamed
with triumph.

¡°What do you decide on, sir?¡± asked the notary of Villefort.

¡°Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know
he never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs will
go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is
ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,
therefore, act according to my conscience.¡±

Having said this, Villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his
father at liberty to do as he pleased. The same day the will was made,
the witnesses were brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in
the presence of all and given in charge to M. Deschamps, the family
notary.






Chapter 60. The Telegraph

M. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte
Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered
into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there. Madame de
Villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion
to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her
bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend upon himself,
proceeded at once to the salon.

Although M. de Villefort flattered himself that, to all outward view, he
had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind, he
did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so much so
that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his sombre
and thoughtful air.

¡°Ma foi!¡± said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over,
¡°what is the matter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the
moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?¡±

Villefort tried to smile.

¡°No, count,¡± he replied, ¡°I am the only victim in this case. It is I who
lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have
caused it to be decided against me.¡±

¡°To what do you refer?¡± said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest.
¡°Have you really met with some great misfortune?¡±

¡°Oh, no, monsieur,¡± said Villefort with a bitter smile; ¡°it is only a
loss of money which I have sustained¡ªnothing worth mentioning, I assure
you.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°the loss of a sum of money becomes almost
immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your
philosophic spirit.¡±

¡°It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,¡± said Villefort,
¡°though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but I am the
more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the
power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the
prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man
relapsed into second childhood.¡±

30183m


¡°What do you say?¡± said the count; ¡°900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum
which might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of
all this annoyance?¡±

¡°My father, as I told you.¡±

¡°M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely
paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?¡±

¡°Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,
nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.
I left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating
his will to two notaries.¡±

¡°But to do this he must have spoken?¡±

¡°He has done better than that¡ªhe has made himself understood.¡±

¡°How was such a thing possible?¡±

¡°By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you
perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.¡±

¡°My dear,¡± said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room,
¡°perhaps you exaggerate the evil.¡±

¡°Good-morning, madame,¡± said the count, bowing.

Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most
gracious smiles.

¡°What is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?¡± demanded Monte
Cristo ¡°and what incomprehensible misfortune¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Incomprehensible is the word!¡± interrupted the procureur, shrugging his
shoulders. ¡°It is an old man¡¯s caprice!¡±

¡°And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Madame de Villefort; ¡°and it is still entirely in the power
of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of Valentine,
to be altered in her favor.¡±

The count, who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning
to speak in parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation,
and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward, who was
mischievously pouring some ink into the bird¡¯s water-glass.

¡°My dear,¡± said Villefort, in answer to his wife, ¡°you know I have never
been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I ever
considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod.
Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected in my
family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child
should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for
so many years. The Baron d¡¯¨¦pinay was my friend, as you know, and an
alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be
arranged.¡±

¡°Do you think,¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°that Valentine is in league
with him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not
be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but
the execution of a plan concerted between them.¡±

¡°Madame,¡± said Villefort, ¡°believe me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is
not so easily renounced.¡±

¡°She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir,
since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a
convent.¡±

¡°Never mind,¡± replied Villefort; ¡°I say that this marriage shall be
consummated.¡±

¡°Notwithstanding your father¡¯s wishes to the contrary?¡± said Madame de
Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. ¡°That is a serious thing.¡±

Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every
word that was said.

30185m


¡°Madame,¡± replied Villefort ¡°I can truly say that I have always
entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural
feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral
superiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be
reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to
obey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting
the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his
anger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by
such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect
toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary
deprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in my
determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his
side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz
d¡¯¨¦pinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for
her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter¡¯s
hand on whomever I please.¡±

¡°What?¡± said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had
frequently solicited during this speech. ¡°What? Do you say that M.
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to
marry M. le Baron Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡±

¡°Yes, sir, that is the reason,¡± said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders.

¡°The apparent reason, at least,¡± said Madame de Villefort.

¡°The real reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.¡±

¡°But I want to know in what way M. d¡¯¨¦pinay can have displeased your
father more than any other person?¡±

¡°I believe I know M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay,¡± said the count; ¡°is he not the son
of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d¡¯¨¦pinay by Charles X.?¡±

¡°The same,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.¡±

¡°He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier
to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in
their affection,¡± said Madame de Villefort.

¡°But,¡± said Monte Cristo ¡°do you not know any cause for this hatred?¡±

¡°Ah, ma foi! who is to know?¡±

¡°Perhaps it is some political difference?¡±

¡°My father and the Baron d¡¯¨¦pinay lived in the stormy times of which I
only saw the ending,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Was not your father a Bonapartist?¡± asked Monte Cristo; ¡°I think I
remember that you told me something of that kind.¡±

¡°My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,¡± said Villefort,
carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; ¡°and the senator¡¯s
robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the
old man without in any degree changing him. When my father conspired, it
was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for M. Noirtier
possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian schemes which
could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to
the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The
Mountain,¡ªtheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed
necessary to bring about the desired result.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°it is just as I thought; it was politics
which brought Noirtier and M. d¡¯¨¦pinay into personal contact. Although
General d¡¯¨¦pinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain royalist
sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening
on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the
supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?¡±

Villefort looked at the count almost with terror.

¡°Am I mistaken, then?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,¡± said Madame de
Villefort; ¡°and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M. de
Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two
children of these inveterate enemies.¡±

¡°It was a sublime and charitable thought,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°and the
whole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle
Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay.¡±

Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read
in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had
just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and
prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile
he was so constantly in the habit of assuming.

¡°Although,¡± said Villefort, ¡°it will be a serious thing for Valentine to
lose her grandfather¡¯s fortune, I do not think that M. d¡¯¨¦pinay will be
frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater
esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in
order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich
in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit
the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, her mother¡¯s parents, who
both love her tenderly.¡±

¡°And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,¡±
said Madame de Villefort; ¡°besides, they are to come to Paris in about a
month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up
with M. Noirtier.¡±

The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love
and defeated ambition.

¡°But it seems to me,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°and I must begin by asking
your pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits
Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose
father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against
this dear Edward.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it
is impossible to describe; ¡°is it not unjust¡ªshamefully unjust? Poor
Edward is as much M. Noirtier¡¯s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if she
had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left her
all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her
grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.¡±

The count listened and said no more.

¡°Count,¡± said Villefort, ¡°we will not entertain you any longer with our
family misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow
charitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my
lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have the
satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and
feeling. M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum,
shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.¡±

¡°However,¡± said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which
incessantly occupied her mind, ¡°perhaps it would be better to explain
this unlucky affair to M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, in order to give him the opportunity
of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de
Villefort.¡±

¡°Ah, that would be a great pity,¡± said Villefort.

¡°A great pity,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Undoubtedly,¡± said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, ¡°a
marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit
on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to
put an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M.
d¡¯¨¦pinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than
ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a
decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.¡±

¡°I agree with M. de Villefort,¡± said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on
Madame de Villefort; ¡°and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to
allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told
M. d¡¯¨¦pinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all
possibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project
which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.¡±

The procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife
slightly changed color.

¡°Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a counsellor
such as you are,¡± said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo.
¡°Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it
had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a thing as
a change in our original plans.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said the count, ¡°the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with
your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M. d¡¯¨¦pinay,
even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry, which he
will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which
could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a
duty.¡±

At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart.

¡°Are you going to leave us, count?¡± said Madame de Villefort.

¡°I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of
your promise for Saturday.¡±

¡°Did you fear that we should forget it?¡±

¡°You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important
and urgent occupations.¡±

¡°My husband has given me his word, sir,¡± said Madame de Villefort; ¡°you
have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose,
and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything
to gain.¡±

¡°And,¡± said Villefort, ¡°is it at your house in the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es that
you receive your visitors?¡±

¡°No,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°which is precisely the reason which renders
your kindness more meritorious,¡ªit is in the country.¡±

¡°In the country?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?¡±

¡°Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,¡ªit is at Auteuil.¡±

¡°At Auteuil?¡± said Villefort; ¡°true, Madame de Villefort told me you
lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in
what part of Auteuil do you reside?¡±

¡°Rue de la Fontaine.¡±

¡°Rue de la Fontaine!¡± exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; ¡°at what
number?¡±

¡°No. 28.¡±

¡°Then,¡± cried Villefort, ¡°was it you who bought M. de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s
house!¡±

¡°Did it belong to M. de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡± demanded Monte Cristo.

¡°Yes,¡± replied Madame de Villefort; ¡°and, would you believe it, count¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Believe what?¡±

¡°You think this house pretty, do you not?¡±

¡°I think it charming.¡±

¡°Well, my husband would never live in it.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡± returned Monte Cristo, ¡°that is a prejudice on your part, M.
de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.¡±

¡°I do not like Auteuil, sir,¡± said the procureur, making an evident
effort to appear calm.

¡°But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of
the pleasure of your company, sir,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°No, count,¡ªI hope¡ªI assure you I shall do my best,¡± stammered
Villefort.

¡°Oh,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°I allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six
o¡¯clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall
think¡ªfor how do I know to the contrary?¡ªthat this house, which has
remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition
or dreadful legend connected with it.¡±

¡°I will come, count,¡ªI will be sure to come,¡± said Villefort eagerly.

¡°Thank you,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°now you must permit me to take my leave
of you.¡±

¡°You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,¡± said
Madame de Villefort, ¡°and you were about to tell us why when your
attention was called to some other subject.¡±

¡°Indeed madame,¡± said Monte Cristo: ¡°I scarcely know if I dare tell you
where I am going.¡±

¡°Nonsense; say on.¡±

¡°Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for
hours together.¡±

¡°What is it?¡±

¡°A telegraph. So now I have told my secret.¡±

¡°A telegraph?¡± repeated Madame de Villefort.

¡°Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a
hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every
direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I
assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could
not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should
be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the
distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting
at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the
opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on
the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii,
sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences,
until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never
occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects,
with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their
stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals,
factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the
mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred
francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an
astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in
enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his
monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed
fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At length I felt a
desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor to
understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they
occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string.¡±

30191m


¡°And are you going there?¡±

¡°I am.¡±

¡°What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or
of the observatory?¡±

¡°Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand
things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to
explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not
understand. Ma foi! I should wish to keep my illusions concerning
insects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I
had formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either
of these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a
good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is
employed to work.¡±

¡°You are a singular man,¡± said Villefort.

¡°What line would you advise me to study?¡±

¡°The one that is most in use just at this time.¡±

¡°The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?¡±

¡°Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain
to you¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°No,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°since, as I told you before, I do not wish to
comprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a
telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. Duchatel,
or from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified
by two Greek words, t¨ºle, graphein. It is the insect with black claws,
and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its
purity and all its importance.¡±

¡°Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will
not be able to see anything.¡±

¡°Ma foi! you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?¡±

¡°Yes; the road to Bayonne.¡±

¡°And afterwards the road to Chatillon?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°By the tower of Montlh¨¦ry, you mean?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Thank you. Good-bye. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions
concerning the telegraph.¡±

At the door the count was met by the two notaries, who had just
completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine, and who were
leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail
of redounding considerably to their credit.






Chapter 61. How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His
Peaches

Not on the same night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count
of Monte Cristo went out by the Barri¨¨re d¡¯Enfer, taking the road to
Orl¨¦ans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the
telegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count
reached the tower of Montlh¨¦ry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the
highest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the
count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about
eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself
stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and
white flowers.

Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long
in finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened
with a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate
opened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet
long by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which
contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the
other by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.

No one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,
floral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed
up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have
been capable of telling strange things, if,¡ªin addition to the menacing
ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,¡ªit had also a
voice.

The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of
thick box, of many years¡¯ growth, and of a tone and color that would
have delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was
formed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a
walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.

Never had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been
honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid
to her in this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which
formed the parterre, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there
evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to
plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not because the damp had
been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the thick
foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural
humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by
artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners
of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who,
from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of
the basin. There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths, or a
weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her
geraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, in her porcelain jardini¨¨re
with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his
little enclosure.

Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the
string to the nail, and cast a look around.

¡°The man at the telegraph,¡± said he, ¡°must either engage a gardener or
devote himself passionately to agriculture.¡±

Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow
filled with leaves; the something rose, uttering an exclamation of
astonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty
years old, who was plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon
grape leaves. He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries,
which, on rising suddenly, he let fall from his hand.

¡°You are gathering your crop, sir?¡± said Monte Cristo, smiling.

30193m


¡°Excuse me, sir,¡± replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; ¡°I am
not up there, I know, but I have only just come down.¡±

¡°Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,¡± said the
count; ¡°gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.¡±

¡°I have ten left,¡± said the man, ¡°for here are eleven, and I had twenty-
one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the spring has
been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir. This is the
reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have this year,
you see, eleven, already plucked¡ªtwelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here last
night, sir¡ªI am sure they were here¡ªI counted them. It must be the son
of M¨¨re Simon who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here this
morning. Ah, the young rascal¡ªstealing in a garden¡ªhe does not know
where that may lead him to.¡±

¡°Certainly, it is wrong,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°but you should take into
consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.¡±

¡°Of course,¡± said the gardener, ¡°but that does not make it the less
unpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer
that I am detaining here.¡± And he glanced timidly at the count¡¯s blue
coat.

30197m


¡°Calm yourself, my friend,¡± said the count, with the smile which he made
at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed only the
kindliest feeling; ¡°I am not an inspector, but a traveller, brought here
by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to lose your
time.¡±

¡°Ah, my time is not valuable,¡± replied the man with a melancholy smile.
¡°Still it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but,
having received the signal that I might rest for an hour¡± (here he
glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of
Montlh¨¦ry, even a sun-dial), ¡°and having ten minutes before me, and my
strawberries being ripe, when a day longer¡ªby-the-by, sir, do you think
dormice eat them?¡±

¡°Indeed, I should think not,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°dormice are bad
neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.¡±

¡°What? Did the Romans eat them?¡± said the gardener¡ª¡°ate dormice?¡±

¡°I have read so in Petronius,¡± said the count.

¡°Really? They can¡¯t be nice, though they do say ¡®as fat as a dormouse.¡¯
It is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day, and only waking to
eat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricots¡ªthey stole one, I
had one nectarine, only one¡ªwell, sir, they ate half of it on the wall;
a splendid nectarine¡ªI never ate a better.¡±

¡°You ate it?¡±

¡°That is to say, the half that was left¡ªyou understand; it was
exquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels; like
M¨¨re Simon¡¯s son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But this
year,¡± continued the horticulturist, ¡°I¡¯ll take care it shall not
happen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch
when the strawberries are ripe.¡±

Monte Cristo had seen enough. Every man has a devouring passion in his
heart, as every fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was
horticulture. He began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the sun
from the grapes, and won the heart of the gardener.

¡°Did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?¡± he said.

¡°Yes, if it isn¡¯t contrary to the rules.¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± said the gardener; ¡°not in the least, since there is no danger
that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying.¡±

¡°I have been told,¡± said the count, ¡°that you do not always yourselves
understand the signals you repeat.¡±

¡°That is true, sir, and that is what I like best,¡± said the man,
smiling.

¡°Why do you like that best?¡±

¡°Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and nothing
else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.¡±

¡°Is it possible,¡± said Monte Cristo to himself, ¡°that I can have met
with a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, ¡°the ten minutes are
almost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with me?¡±

¡°I follow you.¡±

Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into three stories.
The tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes, watering-pots,
hung against the wall; this was all the furniture. The second was the
man¡¯s conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it contained a few
poor articles of household furniture¡ªa bed, a table, two chairs, a stone
pitcher¡ªand some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling, which the count
recognized as sweet peas, and of which the good man was preserving the
seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master
botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.

¡°Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?¡± asked
Monte Cristo.

¡°The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that was
so tedious.¡±

¡°And what is the pay?¡±

¡°A thousand francs, sir.¡±

¡°It is nothing.¡±

¡°No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.¡±

Monte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was
the telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles
by which the machine was worked. ¡°It is very interesting,¡± he said, ¡°but
it must be very tedious for a lifetime.¡±

¡°Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end of
a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of recreation,
and our holidays.¡±

¡°Holidays?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°When?¡±

¡°When we have a fog.¡±

¡°Ah, to be sure.¡±

¡°Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I
prune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long.¡±

¡°How long have you been here?¡±

¡°Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.¡±

¡°You are¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Fifty-five years old.¡±

¡°How long must you have served to claim the pension?¡±

¡°Oh, sir, twenty-five years.¡±

¡°And how much is the pension?¡±

¡°A hundred crowns.¡±

¡°Poor humanity!¡± murmured Monte Cristo.

¡°What did you say, sir?¡± asked the man.

¡°I was saying it was very interesting.¡±

¡°What was?¡±

¡°All you were showing me. And you really understand none of these
signals?¡±

¡°None at all.¡±

¡°And have you never tried to understand them?¡±

¡°Never. Why should I?¡±

¡°But still there are some signals only addressed to you.¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

¡°And do you understand them?¡±

¡°They are always the same.¡±

¡°And they mean¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°¡®Nothing new; You have an hour;¡¯ or ¡®Tomorrow.¡¯¡±

¡°This is simple enough,¡± said the count; ¡°but look, is not your
correspondent putting itself in motion?¡±

¡°Ah, yes; thank you, sir.¡±

¡°And what is it saying¡ªanything you understand?¡±

¡°Yes; it asks if I am ready.¡±

¡°And you reply?¡±

¡°By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand
correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand
correspondent to prepare in his turn.¡±

¡°It is very ingenious,¡± said the count.

¡°You will see,¡± said the man proudly; ¡°in five minutes he will speak.¡±

¡°I have, then, five minutes,¡± said Monte Cristo to himself; ¡°it is more
time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a
question?¡±

¡°What is it, sir?¡±

¡°You are fond of gardening?¡±

¡°Passionately.¡±

¡°And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty
feet, an enclosure of two acres?¡±

¡°Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it.¡±

¡°You live badly on your thousand francs?¡±

¡°Badly enough; but yet I do live.¡±

¡°Yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.¡±

¡°True, the garden is not large.¡±

¡°And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat
everything.¡±

¡°Ah, they are my scourges.¡±

¡°Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your
right-hand correspondent was telegraphing¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I should not see him.¡±

¡°Then what would happen?¡±

¡°I could not repeat the signals.¡±

¡°And then?¡±

¡°Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined.¡±

¡°How much?¡±

¡°A hundred francs.¡±

¡°The tenth of your income¡ªthat would be fine work.¡±

¡°Ah!¡± said the man.

¡°Has it ever happened to you?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.¡±

¡°Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?¡±

¡°Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my pension.¡±

¡°Three hundred francs?¡±

¡°A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any
of these things.¡±

¡°Not even for fifteen years¡¯ wages? Come, it is worth thinking about?¡±

¡°For fifteen thousand francs?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Sir, you alarm me.¡±

¡°Nonsense.¡±

¡°Sir, you are tempting me?¡±

¡°Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?¡±

¡°Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.¡±

¡°On the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.¡±

¡°What is it?¡±

¡°What? Do you not know these bits of paper?¡±

¡°Bank-notes!¡±

¡°Exactly; there are fifteen of them.¡±

¡°And whose are they?¡±

¡°Yours, if you like.¡±

¡°Mine?¡± exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.

¡°Yes; yours¡ªyour own property.¡±

¡°Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.¡±

¡°Let him signal.¡±

¡°Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.¡±

¡°That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to
take my bank-notes.¡±

¡°Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is
impatient.¡±

¡°Never mind¡ªtake these;¡± and the count placed the packet in the man¡¯s
hands. ¡°Now this is not all,¡± he said; ¡°you cannot live upon your
fifteen thousand francs.¡±

¡°I shall still have my place.¡±

¡°No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent¡¯s
message.¡±

¡°Oh, sir, what are you proposing?¡±

¡°A jest.¡±

¡°Sir, unless you force me¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I think I can effectually force you;¡± and Monte Cristo drew another
packet from his pocket. ¡°Here are ten thousand more francs,¡± he said,
¡°with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make
twenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty little
house with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring
you in a thousand francs a year.¡±

¡°A garden with two acres of land!¡±

¡°And a thousand francs a year.¡±

¡°Oh, heavens!¡±

¡°Come, take them,¡± and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his hand.

¡°What am I to do?¡±

¡°Nothing very difficult.¡±

¡°But what is it?¡±

¡°To repeat these signs.¡± Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket, upon
which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order in
which they were to be worked.

¡°There, you see it will not take long.¡±

¡°Yes; but¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.¡±

The shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow,
the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the
count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand
correspondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the
gardener had gone mad. As to the left-hand one, he conscientiously
repeated the same signals, which were finally transmitted to the
Minister of the Interior.

¡°Now you are rich,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Yes,¡± replied the man, ¡°but at what a price!¡±

¡°Listen, friend,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°I do not wish to cause you any
remorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have wronged no
man, but on the contrary have benefited mankind.¡±

The man looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale,
then red, then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water, but he
had no time to reach the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his
dried herbs. Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister,
Debray had the horses put to his carriage, and drove to Danglars¡¯ house.

¡°Has your husband any Spanish bonds?¡± he asked of the baroness.

¡°I think so, indeed! He has six millions¡¯ worth.¡±

¡°He must sell them at whatever price.¡±

¡°Why?¡±

¡°Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain.¡±

30203m


¡°How do you know?¡± Debray shrugged his shoulders.

¡°The idea of asking how I hear the news,¡± he said.

The baroness did not wait for a repetition; she ran to her husband, who
immediately hastened to his agent, and ordered him to sell at any price.
When it was seen that Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell directly.
Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs; but he rid himself of all
his Spanish shares. The same evening the following was read in Le
Messager:

¡°[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of his
guardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian
frontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.¡±

All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,
who had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only
lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept
their shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as
ruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning Le Moniteur contained
the following:

¡°It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced the
flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don Carlos)
has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound
peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to the fog,
was the cause of this error.¡±

The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,
reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference
of a million to Danglars.

¡°Good,¡± said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house when the news
arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been the
victim, ¡°I have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand francs,
for which I would have paid a hundred thousand.¡±

¡°What have you discovered?¡± asked Morrel.

¡°I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that
eat his peaches.¡±






Chapter 62. Ghosts

At first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications
of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the
magnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity was according to
the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing to be altered
outside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before the door opened,
the scene changed.

M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing,
and in the rapidity with which it was executed. It is told that the Duc
d¡¯Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed
Louis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court
with poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of
the house, and in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones,
half hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid
down, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For the rest, the
orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to
Bertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted, and the
shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving-
stones.

Thus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself declared
that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a framework of trees.
The overseer would not have objected, while he was about it, to have
made some improvements in the garden, but the count had positively
forbidden it to be touched. Bertuccio made amends, however, by loading
the antechambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces with flowers.

What, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the
profound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of the
other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad
and gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to
be the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of life,
was scented with its master¡¯s favorite perfumes, and had the very light
regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had under
his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite
pictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the
antechamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with
their music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the
sleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses we
have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them, we
leave a part of our souls.

The servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard; some, belonging to
the kitchens, gliding down the stairs, restored but the previous day, as
if they had always inhabited the house; others filling the coach-houses,
where the equipages, encased and numbered, appeared to have been
installed for the last fifty years; and in the stables the horses
replied with neighs to the grooms, who spoke to them with much more
respect than many servants pay their masters.

The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and
contained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely
devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the
day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and
gold binding.

On the other side of the house, to match with the library, was the
conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in china jars;
and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to sight and smell,
was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the
past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth.

One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio.
Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by
the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio
with terror.

At five o¡¯clock precisely, the count arrived before the house at
Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with
impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments,
while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte Cristo
descended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without giving
any sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his bedroom,
situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a
little piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had noticed at a
previous visit.

¡°That can only be to hold gloves,¡± he said.

¡°Will your excellency deign to open it?¡± said the delighted Bertuccio,
¡°and you will find gloves in it.¡±

Elsewhere the count found everything he required¡ªsmelling-bottles,
cigars, knick-knacks.

30207m


¡°Good,¡± he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so
powerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who
surrounded him.

At precisely six o¡¯clock the clatter of horses¡¯ hoofs was heard at the
entrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who had arrived on M¨¦d¨¦ah.
¡°I am sure I am the first,¡± cried Morrel; ¡°I did it on purpose to have
you a minute to myself, before everyone came. Julie and Emmanuel have a
thousand things to tell you. Ah, really this is magnificent! But tell
me, count, will your people take care of my horse?¡±

¡°Do not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilian¡ªthey understand.¡±

¡°I mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he
came¡ªlike the wind!¡±

¡°I should think so,¡ªa horse that cost 5,000 francs!¡± said Monte Cristo,
in the tone which a father would use towards a son.

¡°Do you regret them?¡± asked Morrel, with his open laugh.

¡°I? Certainly not,¡± replied the count. ¡°No; I should only regret if the
horse had not proved good.¡±

¡°It is so good, that I have distanced M. de Chateau-Renaud, one of the
best riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the minister¡¯s
Arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars,
who always go at six leagues an hour.¡±

¡°Then they follow you?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°See, they are here.¡± And at the same minute a carriage with smoking
horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate, which
opened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the steps,
followed by the horsemen.

The instant Debray had touched the ground, he was at the carriage-door.
He offered his hand to the baroness, who, descending, took it with a
peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo. But
nothing escaped the count¡¯s notice, and he observed a little note,
passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice, from the hand
of Madame Danglars to that of the minister¡¯s secretary.

After his wife the banker descended, as pale as though he had issued
from his tomb instead of his carriage.

Madame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be
interpreted by Monte Cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle,
and across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion,
which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her
color, she ascended the steps, saying to Morrel:

¡°Sir, if you were a friend of mine, I should ask you if you would sell
your horse.¡±

Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned
round to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his
embarrassment. The count understood him.

¡°Ah, madame,¡± he said, ¡°why did you not make that request of me?¡±

¡°With you, sir,¡± replied the baroness, ¡°one can wish for nothing, one is
so sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrel¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Unfortunately,¡± replied the count, ¡°I am witness that M. Morrel cannot
give up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it.¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°He laid a wager he would tame M¨¦d¨¦ah in the space of six months. You
understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time
named, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was
afraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to gratify
a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred
obligations in the world.¡±

¡°You see my position, madame,¡± said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile
on Monte Cristo.

¡°It seems to me,¡± said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a
forced smile, ¡°that you have already got horses enough.¡±

Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed,
but, to the surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it,
and said nothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and
showed her two immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants,
of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness was
astonished.

¡°Why,¡± said she, ¡°you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the
Tuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?¡±

¡°Ah! madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°you must not ask of us, the
manufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work of
another age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.¡±

¡°How so?¡ªat what period can that have been?¡±

¡°I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven
built expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were
successively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten
were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing what
was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them with
coral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by two
hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a revolution
carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and only left the
documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the
sea. At the end of two hundred years the documents were found, and they
thought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended in machines, made
expressly on the discovery, into the bay where they were thrown; but of
ten three only remained, the rest having been broken by the waves. I am
fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps, misshapen, frightful monsters
have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in which myriads of small fish
have slept, seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies.¡±

Meanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was
mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one
after another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at
the cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,
pricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though
awaking from a dream.

¡°Sir,¡± said Monte Cristo to him, ¡°I do not recommend my pictures to you,
who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are two by
Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael, a Van
Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.¡±

¡°Stay,¡± said Debray; ¡°I recognize this Hobbema.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed!¡±

¡°Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.¡±

¡°Which, I believe, does not contain one?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°No; and yet they refused to buy it.¡±

¡°Why?¡± said Chateau-Renaud.

¡°You pretend not to know,¡ªbecause government was not rich enough.¡±

¡°Ah, pardon me,¡± said Chateau-Renaud; ¡°I have heard of these things
every day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them
yet.¡±

¡°You will, by and by,¡± said Debray.

¡°I think not,¡± replied Chateau-Renaud.

¡°Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,¡± announced
Baptistin.

A black satin stock, fresh from the maker¡¯s hands, gray moustaches, a
bold eye, a major¡¯s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five
crosses¡ªin fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier¡ªsuch was the
appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom
we are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely new
clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son,
whom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On the
entrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to son, and
then, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began
criticising.

¡°Cavalcanti!¡± said Debray.

¡°A fine name,¡± said Morrel.

¡°Yes,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°these Italians are well named and badly
dressed.¡±

¡°You are fastidious, Chateau-Renaud,¡± replied Debray; ¡°those clothes are
well cut and quite new.¡±

¡°That is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be well
dressed for the first time in his life.¡±

¡°Who are those gentlemen?¡± asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.

¡°You heard¡ªCavalcanti.¡±

¡°That tells me their name, and nothing else.¡±

¡°Ah! true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all
descended from princes.¡±

¡°Have they any fortune?¡±

¡°An enormous one.¡±

¡°What do they do?¡±

¡°Try to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think, from
what they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them here
today on your account. I will introduce you to them.¡±

¡°But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,¡± said
Danglars.

¡°The son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near
Marseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic.¡±

¡°Upon what subject?¡± asked Madame Danglars.

¡°The French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife from
Paris.¡±

¡°A fine idea that of his,¡± said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any
other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she
controlled herself.

¡°The baron appears thoughtful today,¡± said Monte Cristo to her; ¡°are
they going to put him in the ministry?¡±

¡°Not yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse,
and has lost money.¡±

¡°M. and Madame de Villefort,¡± cried Baptistin.

They entered. M. de Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was
visibly affected, and when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it
tremble.

¡°Certainly, women alone know how to dissimulate,¡± said Monte Cristo to
himself, glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur,
and embracing his wife.

After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who, until then, had been
occupied on the other side of the house, glide into an adjoining room.
He went to him.

¡°What do you want, M. Bertuccio?¡± said he.

¡°Your excellency has not stated the number of guests.¡±

¡°Ah, true.¡±

¡°How many covers?¡±

¡°Count for yourself.¡±

¡°Is everyone here, your excellency?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

Bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched
him. ¡°Good heavens!¡± he exclaimed.

¡°What is the matter?¡± said the count.

¡°That woman¡ªthat woman!¡±

¡°Which?¡±

¡°The one with a white dress and so many diamonds¡ªthe fair one.¡±

¡°Madame Danglars?¡±

¡°I do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!¡±

¡°Whom do you mean?¡±

¡°The woman of the garden!¡ªshe that was enceinte¡ªshe who was walking
while she waited for¡ª¡ª¡±

Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair on
end.

¡°Waiting for whom?¡± Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort
with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo.

¡°Oh, oh!¡± he at length muttered, ¡°do you see?¡±

¡°What? Who?¡±

¡°Him!¡±

¡°Him!¡ªM. de Villefort, the king¡¯s attorney? Certainly I see him.¡±

¡°Then I did not kill him?¡±

¡°Really, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio,¡± said the count.

¡°Then he is not dead?¡±

30213m


¡°No; you see plainly he is not dead. Instead of striking between the
sixth and seventh left ribs, as your countrymen do, you must have struck
higher or lower, and life is very tenacious in these lawyers, or rather
there is no truth in anything you have told me¡ªit was a fright of the
imagination, a dream of your fancy. You went to sleep full of thoughts
of vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had the
nightmare¡ªthat¡¯s all. Come, calm yourself, and reckon them up¡ªM. and
Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M. de Chateau-
Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,
eight.¡±

¡°Eight!¡± repeated Bertuccio.

¡°Stop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off¡ªyou forget one of my
guests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,
the young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo¡¯s ¡®Madonna¡¯; now he is
turning.¡±

This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had not a look
from Monte Cristo silenced him.

¡°Benedetto?¡± he muttered; ¡°fatality!¡±

¡°Half-past six o¡¯clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio,¡± said the count
severely; ¡°I ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;¡±
and he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the
wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards the
doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing
said, with a violent effort, ¡°The dinner waits.¡±

The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. ¡°M. de
Villefort,¡± he said, ¡°will you conduct the Baroness Danglars?¡±

Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.






Chapter 63. The Dinner

It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering
the dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them
to this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they
still felt that they would not like to be absent. The recent events, the
solitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost
incredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have altogether
prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own
sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to
overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum.

And all present, even including Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding
the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other, were
thoughtful, on finding themselves assembled at the house of this
incomprehensible man. Madame Danglars had started when Villefort, on the
count¡¯s invitation, offered his arm; and Villefort felt that his glance
was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles, when he felt the arm of the
baroness press upon his own. None of this had escaped the count, and
even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired
considerable interest for an observer.

M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on his left
Morrel. The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars;
the other seats were filled by Debray, who was placed between the two
Cavalcanti, and by Chateau-Renaud, seated between Madame de Villefort
and Morrel.

The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to
overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
appetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to
them, but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to
prepare. Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could
provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare birds,
retaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon
massive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the
Archipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose
grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,¡ªall
these, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his
guests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians,
who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a
dinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls, like
Cleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo de¡¯ Medici.

Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing and
joking about it.

¡°Gentlemen,¡± he said, ¡°you will admit that, when arrived at a certain
degree of fortune, the superfluities of life are all that can be
desired; and the ladies will allow that, after having risen to a certain
eminence of position, the ideal alone can be more exalted. Now, to
follow out this reasoning, what is the marvellous?¡ªthat which we do not
understand. What is it that we really desire?¡ªthat which we cannot
obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot understand, to procure
impossibilities, these are the study of my life. I gratify my wishes by
two means¡ªmy will and my money. I take as much interest in the pursuit
of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new railway line;
you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you, M. Debray,
in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de Chateau-Renaud, in pleasing a woman;
and you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride. For example,
you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St.
Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples. Is it not amusing to see
them both on the same table?¡±

¡°What are the two fish?¡± asked Danglars.

¡°M. Chateau-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of
one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of
the other.¡±

¡°This one is, I think, a sterlet,¡± said Chateau-Renaud.

¡°And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.¡±

¡°Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.¡±

¡°Sterlets,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°are only found in the Volga.¡±

¡°And,¡± said Cavalcanti, ¡°I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys
of that size.¡±

¡°Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.¡±

¡°Impossible!¡± cried all the guests simultaneously.

¡°Well, this is just what amuses me,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°I am like
Nero¡ªcupitor impossibilium; and that is what is amusing you at this
moment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no
better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it, and
here it is.¡±

¡°But how could you have these fish brought to France?¡±

¡°Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask¡ªone filled
with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they
were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe
me, M. Danglars!¡±

¡°I cannot help doubting,¡± answered Danglars with his stupid smile.

¡°Baptistin,¡± said the count, ¡°have the other fish brought in¡ªthe sterlet
and the lamprey which came in the other casks, and which are yet alive.¡±

Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands.
Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants, and in
each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.

¡°But why have two of each sort?¡± asked Danglars.

¡°Merely because one might have died,¡± carelessly answered Monte Cristo.

¡°You are certainly an extraordinary man,¡± said Danglars; ¡°and
philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.¡±

¡°And to have ideas,¡± added Madame Danglars.

¡°Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans,
who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from
Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus,
and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish. It was
also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing sight
to see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four times,
and like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the prismatic
shades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. Their agony formed
part of their merit¡ªif they were not seen alive, they were despised when
dead.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Debray, ¡°but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°but what would be the use of living eighteen
hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than he could?¡±

The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense
not to say anything.

¡°All this is very extraordinary,¡± said Chateau-Renaud; ¡°still, what I
admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude with which
your orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought this house
five or six days ago?¡±

¡°Certainly not longer.¡±

¡°Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I remember
rightly, it had another entrance, and the courtyard was paved and empty;
while today we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which appear to
be a hundred years old.¡±

¡°Why not? I am fond of grass and shade,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Yes,¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°the door was towards the road before,
and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house
from the road, I remember.¡±

¡°Yes, madame,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°but I preferred having an entrance
which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate.¡±

¡°In four days,¡± said Morrel; ¡°it is extraordinary!¡±

¡°Indeed,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°it seems quite miraculous to make a new
house out of an old one; for it was very old, and dull too. I recollect
coming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-M¨¦ran advertised it
for sale two or three years ago.¡±

¡°M. de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡± said Madame de Villefort; ¡°then this house belonged
to M. de Saint-M¨¦ran before you bought it?¡±

¡°It appears so,¡± replied Monte Cristo.

¡°Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?¡±

¡°Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.¡±

¡°It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,¡± said
Chateau-Renaud, ¡°and it was quite melancholy to look at it, with the
blinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court. Really, if
the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one
might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had
been committed.¡±

Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare
wine which were placed before him, here took one, and drank it off.
Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then said:

¡°It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first time
I came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my
steward had not taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the fellow
had been bribed by the notary.¡±

¡°It is probable,¡± stammered out Villefort, trying to smile; ¡°but I can
assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding. This house
is part of Valentine¡¯s marriage-portion, and M. de Saint-M¨¦ran wished to
sell it; for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would
have fallen to ruin.¡±

It was Morrel¡¯s turn to become pale.

¡°There was, above all, one room,¡± continued Monte Cristo, ¡°very plain in
appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to me
quite dramatic.¡±

¡°Why so?¡± said Danglars; ¡°why dramatic?¡±

¡°Can we account for instinct?¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°Are there not some
places where we seem to breathe sadness?¡ªwhy, we cannot tell. It is a
chain of recollections¡ªan idea which carries you back to other times, to
other places¡ªwhich, very likely, have no connection with the present
time and place. And there is something in this room which reminds me
forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona. Stay,
since we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will
take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.¡±

Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose,
Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example.
Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to
their seats; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.

¡°Did you hear?¡± said Madame Danglars.

¡°We must go,¡± replied Villefort, offering his arm.

The others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different
parts of the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to
the one room, and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of
the rest of the building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace.
Each one went out by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who
remained; then, when they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his
face was a smile, which, if they could have understood it, would have
alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to
enter. They began by walking through the apartments, many of which were
fitted up in the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of
beds, and pipes instead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated
with the rarest pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with
draperies from China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and
wonderful texture. At length they arrived at the famous room. There was
nothing particular about it, excepting that, although daylight had
disappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in it was old-fashioned,
while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated. These two causes were
enough to give it a gloomy aspect.

¡°Oh.¡± cried Madame de Villefort, ¡°it is really frightful.¡±

Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. Many
observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion that
there was something sinister about the room.

30221m


¡°Is it not so?¡± asked Monte Cristo. ¡°Look at that large clumsy bed, hung
with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two crayon portraits,
that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say, with their
pale lips and staring eyes, ¡®We have seen¡¯?¡±

Villefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed
near the chimney.

¡°Oh,¡± said Madame de Villefort, smiling, ¡°are you courageous enough to
sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed?¡±

Madame Danglars rose suddenly.

¡°And then,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°this is not all.¡±

¡°What is there more?¡± said Debray, who had not failed to notice the
agitation of Madame Danglars.

¡°Ah, what else is there?¡± said Danglars; ¡°for, at present, I cannot say
that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you say, M.
Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said he, ¡°we have at Pisa, Ugolino¡¯s tower; at Ferrara, Tasso¡¯s
prison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and Paolo.¡±

¡°Yes, but you have not this little staircase,¡± said Monte Cristo,
opening a door concealed by the drapery. ¡°Look at it, and tell me what
you think of it.¡±

¡°What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,¡± said Chateau-Renaud with a
smile.

¡°I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but
certainly everything appears to me black in this house,¡± said Debray.

Ever since Valentine¡¯s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent
and sad.

¡°Can you imagine,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°some Othello or Abb¨¦ de Ganges,
one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step, carrying a
load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not from God?¡±

Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was obliged to
support himself against the wall.

¡°Ah, madame,¡± cried Debray, ¡°what is the matter with you? how pale you
look!¡±

¡°It is very evident what is the matter with her,¡± said Madame de
Villefort; ¡°M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us,
doubtless intending to frighten us to death.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Villefort, ¡°really, count, you frighten the ladies.¡±

¡°What is the matter?¡± asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.

¡°Nothing,¡± she replied with a violent effort. ¡°I want air, that is all.¡±

¡°Will you come into the garden?¡± said Debray, advancing towards the back
staircase.

¡°No, no,¡± she answered, ¡°I would rather remain here.¡±

¡°Are you really frightened, madame?¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Oh, no, sir,¡± said Madame Danglars; ¡°but you suppose scenes in a manner
which gives them the appearance of reality.¡±

30223m


¡°Ah, yes,¡± said Monte Cristo smiling; ¡°it is all a matter of
imagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest
mother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess
Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to
disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
carrying the sleeping child?¡±

Here Madame Danglars, instead of being calmed by the soft picture,
uttered a groan and fainted.

¡°Madame Danglars is ill,¡± said Villefort; ¡°it would be better to take
her to her carriage.¡±

¡°Oh, mon Dieu!¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°and I have forgotten my smelling-
bottle!¡±

¡°I have mine,¡± said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to Monte
Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
properties the count had tested on Edward.

¡°Ah,¡± said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.

¡°Yes,¡± she said, ¡°at your advice I have made the trial.¡±

¡°And have you succeeded?¡±

¡°I think so.¡±

Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo
dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she
returned to consciousness.

¡°Ah,¡± she cried, ¡°what a frightful dream!¡±

Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They
looked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in
poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major
Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte
Cristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and
conducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee
between the Cavalcanti.

¡°Really, madame,¡± he said, ¡°did I alarm you much?¡±

¡°Oh, no, sir,¡± she answered; ¡°but you know, things impress us
differently, according to the mood of our minds.¡± Villefort forced a
laugh.

¡°And then, you know,¡± he said, ¡°an idea, a supposition, is sufficient.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°you may believe me if you like, but it is my
opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.¡±

¡°Take care,¡± said Madame de Villefort, ¡°the king¡¯s attorney is here.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°since that is the case, I will take
advantage of his presence to make my declaration.¡±

¡°Your declaration?¡± said Villefort.

¡°Yes, before witnesses.¡±

¡°Oh, this is very interesting,¡± said Debray; ¡°if there really has been a
crime, we will investigate it.¡±

¡°There has been a crime,¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°Come this way, gentlemen;
come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made
before the competent authorities.¡±

He then took Villefort¡¯s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of
Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-
tree, where the shade was thickest. All the other guests followed.

¡°Stay,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°here, in this very spot¡± (and he stamped
upon the ground), ¡°I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to
refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather,
the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a
newly born infant.¡±

30225m


Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of
Villefort trembled.

¡°A newly born infant,¡± repeated Debray; ¡°this affair becomes serious!¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Chateau-Renaud, ¡°I was not wrong just now then, when I said
that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors
carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because
it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.¡±

¡°Who said it was a crime?¡± asked Villefort, with a last effort.

¡°How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?¡± cried Monte
Cristo. ¡°And pray what do you call such an action?¡±

¡°But who said it was buried alive?¡±

¡°Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a
cemetery.¡±

¡°What is done to infanticides in this country?¡± asked Major Cavalcanti
innocently.

¡°Oh, their heads are soon cut off,¡± said Danglars.

¡°Ah, indeed?¡± said Cavalcanti.

¡°I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?¡± asked Monte Cristo.

¡°Yes, count,¡± replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.

Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,
said:

¡°Come, gentlemen,¡ªsome coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,¡± and he
conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.

¡°Indeed, count,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°I am ashamed to own it, but all
your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me
sit down;¡± and she fell into a chair.

Monte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.

¡°I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,¡± he said. But
before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had
found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, ¡°I must speak to you.¡±

¡°When?¡±

¡°Tomorrow.¡±

¡°Where?¡±

¡°In my office, or in the court, if you like,¡ªthat is the surest place.¡±

¡°I will be there.¡±

At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.

¡°Thanks, my dear friend,¡± said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; ¡°it is
over now, and I am much better.¡±






Chapter 64. The Beggar

The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return
to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the
uneasiness she experienced. On his wife¡¯s request, M. de Villefort was
the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his
landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife.
As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M.
Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While
Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he
had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon
guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been
uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.
Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Chateau-Renaud,
and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort¡¯s
carriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had
offered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury
waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the
English fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.

Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,
and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,
amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king¡¯s attorney. Then he
had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the stiff-
necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration the
hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of
some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir. He
contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on
the major¡¯s little finger; for the major, like a prudent man, in case of
any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them
into an available asset. Then, after dinner, on the pretext of business,
he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the
father and son, previously informed that it was through Danglars the one
was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually,
were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with
the banker¡¯s servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to
expend itself upon.

One thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the
veneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the
principle of Horace, nil admirari, had contented himself with showing
his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore,
concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious
descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout
brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by the same
means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and the
sterlet from the Volga. Thus it was with much politeness of manner that
he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words:

¡°Tomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business.¡±

¡°And I, sir,¡± said Danglars, ¡°shall be most happy to receive you.¡±

Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the H?tel
des Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son.
To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had
lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and carriages,
and that not having come together, it would not be difficult for them to
leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by the side of
Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and
economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son
60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000
or 600,000 livres.

As for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who,
instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it
to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps
to reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the
impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the
reins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot
lightly on the step.

At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The young man turned round,
thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they
wished to tell him, and had returned just as they were starting. But
instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face, sunburnt,
and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles, and a smile
upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth, pointed and
sharp as the wolf¡¯s or jackal¡¯s. A red handkerchief encircled his gray
head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs, which
seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he
walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man¡¯s shoulder,
and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed of gigantic size.

30229m


Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his
tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his
interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered
and stepped back suddenly.

¡°What do you want of me?¡± he asked.

¡°Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,¡± said the man with the red
handkerchief, ¡°but I want to speak to you.¡±

¡°You have no right to beg at night,¡± said the groom, endeavoring to rid
his master of the troublesome intruder.

¡°I am not begging, my fine fellow,¡± said the unknown to the servant,
with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile,
that he withdrew; ¡°I only wish to say two or three words to your master,
who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.¡±

¡°Come,¡± said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to
perceive his agitation, ¡°what do you want? Speak quickly, friend.¡±

The man said, in a low voice: ¡°I wish¡ªI wish you to spare me the walk
back to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner
as you, I can scarcely stand.¡±

The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity.

¡°Tell me,¡± he said¡ª¡°tell me what you want?¡±

¡°Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry
me back.¡± Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.

¡°Yes,¡± said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking
impudently at the youth; ¡°I have taken the whim into my head; do you
understand, Master Benedetto?¡±

At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went
towards his groom, saying:

¡°This man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the
result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab,
that you may not be too late.¡±

The surprised groom retired.

¡°Let me at least reach a shady spot,¡± said Andrea.

¡°Oh, as for that, I¡¯ll take you to a splendid place,¡± said the man with
the handkerchief; and taking the horse¡¯s bit he led the tilbury where it
was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea
conferred upon him.

¡°Don¡¯t think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,¡± said he;
¡°oh, no, it¡¯s only because I am tired, and also because I have a little
business to talk over with you.¡±

¡°Come, step in,¡± said the young man. It was a pity this scene had not
occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing
himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver
of the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village without
saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though well-
pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle. Once out
of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself that he
could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse and
crossing his arms before the man, he asked:

¡°Now, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?¡±

¡°Let me ask you why you deceived me?¡±

¡°How have I deceived you?¡±

¡°¡®How,¡¯ do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you
were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that,
you come to Paris.¡±

¡°How does that annoy you?¡±

¡°It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.¡±

¡°So,¡± said Andrea, ¡°you are speculating upon me?¡±

¡°What fine words he uses!¡±

¡°I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.¡±

¡°Well, well, don¡¯t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is to
be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you were
earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as facchino or
cicerone, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own. You
know I always did call you my child.¡±

¡°Come, come, what then?¡±

¡°Patience¡ªpatience!¡±

¡°I am patient, but go on.¡±

¡°All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a tilbury,
and fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else become a
stockbroker.¡±

¡°So that, as you confess, you are jealous?¡±

¡°No, I am pleased¡ªso pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as I
am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might not
compromise you.¡±

¡°Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!¡± exclaimed Andrea; ¡°you
speak to me before my servant.¡±

¡°How can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you. You
have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an
eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another chance.¡±

¡°You see, I do not conceal myself.¡±

¡°You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself; and
then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,¡± added
Caderousse with his unpleasant smile. ¡°It was very polite of you.¡±

¡°Come,¡± said Andrea, ¡°what do you want?¡±

¡°You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that
is not right¡ªtake care, or I may become troublesome.¡±

This menace smothered the young man¡¯s passion. He urged the horse again
into a trot.

¡°You should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you
said just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Do you know then now what you are?¡±

¡°No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I am
young and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,
everything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune, which
has frowned on you, has been kind to me?¡±

¡°Fortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your
clothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better,¡± said Caderousse,
his eyes sparkling with avarice.

¡°Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,¡± said Andrea,
becoming more and more excited. ¡°If I had been wearing a handkerchief
like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,
you would not have known me.¡±

¡°You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being
as well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your heart.
If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to divide my
soup and beans with you when you were hungry.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Andrea.

¡°What an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?¡±

¡°Oh, yes,¡± replied Andrea, laughing.

¡°How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have
just left?¡±

¡°He is not a prince; simply a count.¡±

¡°A count, and a rich one too, eh?¡±

¡°Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not
a very good-tempered gentleman.¡±

¡°Oh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have him
all to yourself. But,¡± said Caderousse, again smiling with the
disagreeable expression he had before assumed, ¡°you must pay for it¡ªyou
understand?¡±

¡°Well, what do you want?¡±

¡°I think that with a hundred francs a month¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°I could live¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Upon a hundred francs!¡±

¡°Come¡ªyou understand me; but that with¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°With?¡±

¡°With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.¡±

¡°Here are two hundred,¡± said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in the
hand of Caderousse.

30233m


¡°Good!¡± said Caderousse.

¡°Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will
receive the same sum.¡±

¡°There now, again you degrade me.¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business
with you alone.¡±

¡°Well, be it so, then. Take it from me then, and so long at least as I
receive my income, you shall be paid yours.¡±

¡°Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing
when good fortune happens to such as you. But tell me all about it?¡±

¡°Why do you wish to know?¡± asked Cavalcanti.

¡°What? do you again defy me?¡±

¡°No; the fact is, I have found my father.¡±

¡°What? a real father?¡±

¡°Yes, so long as he pays me¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°You¡¯ll honor and believe him¡ªthat¡¯s right. What is his name?¡±

¡°Major Cavalcanti.¡±

¡°Is he pleased with you?¡±

¡°So far I have appeared to answer his purpose.¡±

¡°And who found this father for you?¡±

¡°The Count of Monte Cristo.¡±

¡°The man whose house you have just left?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,
since he holds the money-chest!¡±

¡°Well, I will mention you to him. Meanwhile, what are you going to do?¡±

¡°I?¡±

¡°Yes, you.¡±

¡°It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.¡±

¡°Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn to
ask you some questions.¡±

¡°Ah, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear a
decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a caf¨¦.
Then, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some
retired baker. That is what I want.¡±

¡°Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,
nothing could be better.¡±

¡°Do you think so, M. Bossuet? And you¡ªwhat will you become? A peer of
France?¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Andrea, ¡°who knows?¡±

¡°Major Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is
abolished.¡±

¡°No politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and that
we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.¡±

¡°Not at all, my good friend.¡±

¡°How? Not at all?¡±

¡°Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket,
without reckoning what was there before¡ªmaking in all about two hundred
francs,¡ªwhy, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers. Then, to
justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this would
cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due
notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the
Mediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-bye to my
dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer
remaining honorably in the capital.¡±

Andrea scowled. Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of
Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a
rapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his
pocket, where it began playing with a pistol. But, meanwhile,
Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off his companion, passed his
hand behind his back, and opened a long Spanish knife, which he always
carried with him, to be ready in case of need. The two friends, as we
see, were worthy of and understood one another. Andrea¡¯s hand left his
pocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it
played with for some time.

¡°Good Caderousse,¡± he said, ¡°how happy you will be.¡±

¡°I will do my best,¡± said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting up
his knife.

¡°Well, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the
barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more
danger riding than on foot.¡±

¡°Wait,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°we shall see.¡± He then took the greatcoat with
the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury, and
put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti¡¯s hat, which he placed
upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a
servant whose master drives himself.

¡°But, tell me,¡± said Andrea, ¡°am I to remain bareheaded?¡±

¡°Pooh,¡± said Caderousse; ¡°it is so windy that your hat can easily appear
to have blown off.¡±

¡°Come, come; enough of this,¡± said Cavalcanti.

¡°What are you waiting for?¡± said Caderousse. ¡°I hope I am not the
cause.¡±

¡°Hush,¡± said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident. At the
first cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.

¡°Well!¡± said Andrea,¡ª¡°my servant¡¯s coat and my hat?¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said Caderousse, ¡°you would not like me to risk taking cold?¡±

¡°But what am I to do?¡±

¡°You? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. Au revoir,
Benedetto;¡± and running into a court, he disappeared.

¡°Alas,¡± said Andrea, sighing, ¡°one cannot be completely happy in this
world!¡±






Chapter 65. A Conjugal Scene

At the Place Louis XV. the three young people separated¡ªthat is to say,
Morrel went to the Boulevards, Chateau-Renaud to the Pont de la
R¨¦volution, and Debray to the Quai. Most probably Morrel and Chateau-
Renaud returned to their ¡°domestic hearths,¡± as they say in the gallery
of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of the Rue
Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with Debray.
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the left,
galloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch, and,
issuing from the Rue de la Michodi¨¨re, he arrived at M. Danglars¡¯ door
just at the same time that Villefort¡¯s landau, after having deposited
him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honor¨¦, stopped to leave the
baroness at her own house.

Debray, with the air of a man familiar with the house, entered first
into the court, threw his bridle into the hands of a footman, and
returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to whom he offered his
arm, to conduct her to her apartments. The gate once closed, and Debray
and the baroness alone in the court, he asked:

¡°What was the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at
that story, or rather fable, which the count related?¡±

¡°Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my
friend,¡± said the baroness.

¡°No, Hermine,¡± replied Debray; ¡°you cannot make me believe that; on the
contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count¡¯s.
M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much you care
for his ill-humor. Someone has vexed you; I will allow no one to annoy
you.¡±

¡°You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,¡± replied Madame Danglars; ¡°and
what I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you
remarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to.¡±

It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous
irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to
themselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some
secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone. Being a man
who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent
penalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited
for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her,
or receive an avowal proprio motu.

At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Corn¨¦lie, her
confidential maid.

¡°What is my daughter doing?¡± asked Madame Danglars.

¡°She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,¡± replied
Mademoiselle Corn¨¦lie.

¡°Yet I think I hear her piano.¡±

¡°It is Mademoiselle Louise d¡¯Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle
Danglars is in bed.¡±

¡°Well,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°come and undress me.¡±

They entered the bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch,
and Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle
Corn¨¦lie.

¡°My dear M. Lucien,¡± said Madame Danglars through the door, ¡°you are
always complaining that Eug¨¦nie will not address a word to you.¡±

¡°Madame,¡± said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him
as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, ¡°I am not the only
one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he
could not extract a word from his betrothed.¡±

¡°True,¡± said Madame Danglars; ¡°yet I think this will all pass off, and
that you will one day see her enter your study.¡±

¡°My study?¡±

¡°At least that of the minister.¡±

¡°Why so!¡±

¡°To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an
infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of
fashion.¡±

Debray smiled. ¡°Well,¡± said he, ¡°let her come, with your consent and
that of the baron, and we will try and give her an engagement, though we
are very poor to pay such talent as hers.¡±

¡°Go, Corn¨¦lie,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°I do not require you any longer.¡±

Corn¨¦lie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a
charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she
began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her
for a moment in silence.

¡°Come, Hermine,¡± he said, after a short time, ¡°answer
candidly,¡ªsomething vexes you¡ªis it not so?¡±

30239m


¡°Nothing,¡± answered the baroness.

And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a
looking-glass. ¡°I am frightful tonight,¡± she said. Debray rose, smiling,
and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point, when
the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray reseated himself.
At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round, and looked upon
her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal.

¡°Good-evening, madame,¡± said the banker; ¡°good-evening, M. Debray.¡±

Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire
to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming a
dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her
husband.

¡°Read me something, M. Debray,¡± she said. Debray, who was slightly
disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of
the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife
inlaid with gold.

¡°Excuse me,¡± said the banker, ¡°but you will tire yourself, baroness, by
such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.¡±

Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and
politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness
there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his
wife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her
astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon
her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where
he was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was, that
the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.

¡°M. Lucien,¡± said the baroness, ¡°I assure you I have no desire to sleep,
and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you
must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.¡±

¡°I am at your service, madame,¡± replied Lucien coldly.

¡°My dear M. Debray,¡± said the banker, ¡°do not kill yourself tonight
listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as
well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow
me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.¡±

This time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien
and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with
their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the
irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband
was victorious.

¡°Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,¡± continued
Danglars; ¡°oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask
my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make
such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.¡±

Debray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against
the edge of the door, like Nathan in Athalie.

¡°It is extraordinary,¡± he said, when the door was closed behind him,
¡°how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over
us.¡±

30241m


Lucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open
book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began
playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as Debray,
and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck
and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The animal
uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its destination, it
crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such unusual treatment
remained silent and motionless.

¡°Do you know, sir,¡± asked the baroness, ¡°that you are improving?
Generally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.¡±

¡°It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,¡± replied Danglars.
Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances
frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took
no notice of them.

¡°And what have I to do with your ill-humor?¡± said the baroness,
irritated at the impassibility of her husband; ¡°do these things concern
me? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have
clerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.¡±

¡°Not so,¡± replied Danglars; ¡°your advice is wrong, so I shall not follow
it. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M. Demoustier says, and
I will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My clerks are honest
men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their deserts, if I may
value them according to what they bring in; therefore I shall not get
into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a passion are
those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune.¡±

¡°And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain yourself
more clearly, I beg, sir.¡±

¡°Oh, make yourself easy!¡ªI am not speaking riddles, and you will soon
know what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw
out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.¡±

¡°I do not understand you, sir,¡± said the baroness, trying to disguise
the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.

¡°You understand me perfectly, on the contrary,¡± said Danglars: ¡°but, if
you will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs
upon the Spanish loan.¡±

¡°And pray,¡± asked the baroness, ¡°am I responsible for this loss?¡±

¡°Why not?¡±

¡°Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?¡±

¡°Certainly it is not mine.¡±

¡°Once for all, sir,¡± replied the baroness sharply, ¡°I tell you I will
not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the
house of my parents or in that of my first husband.¡±

¡°Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.¡±

¡°The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the
bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise
of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted,
is odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the
sound of your voice.¡±

¡°Really?¡± said Danglars. ¡°Well, this surprises me, for I thought you
took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!¡±

30243m


¡°I? What could put such an idea into your head?¡±

¡°Yourself.¡±

¡°Ah?¡ªwhat next?¡±

¡°Most assuredly.¡±

¡°I should like to know upon what occasion?¡±

¡°Oh, mon Dieu! that is very easily done. Last February you were the
first who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a ship had
entered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that a
payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how
clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many
shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by
it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as you
pleased; that was your business. In March there was a question about a
grant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each offering
equal securities. You told me that your instinct,¡ªand although you
pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the contrary,
that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs,¡ªwell, you
told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given
to the company called the Southern. I bought two thirds of the shares of
that company; as you had foreseen, the shares trebled in value, and I
picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for pin-
money. How have you spent this 250,000 francs?¡ªit is no business of
mine.¡±

¡°When are you coming to the point?¡± cried the baroness, shivering with
anger and impatience.

¡°Patience, madame, I am coming to it.¡±

¡°That¡¯s fortunate.¡±

¡°In April you went to dine at the minister¡¯s. You heard a private
conversation respecting Spanish affairs¡ªon the expulsion of Don Carlos.
I bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I pocketed
600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these
600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of
them according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not
the less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.¡±

¡°Well, sir, and what then?¡±

¡°Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.¡±

¡°Really, your manner of speaking¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days after
that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his words
that Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares, the news
got out, and I no longer sold¡ªI gave them away, next day I find the news
was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000 francs.¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a
fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.¡±

¡°What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray¡¯s name is mixed
up in this affair.¡±

¡°Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must
have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.¡±

30245m


¡°For shame!¡± exclaimed the baroness.

¡°Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will
oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole
of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while he
smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful
players have never discovered¡ªthat is, a roulette where he wins without
playing, and is no loser when he loses.¡±

The baroness became enraged.

¡°Wretch!¡± she cried, ¡°will you dare to tell me you did not know what you
now reproach me with?¡±

¡°I do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not know
it. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years
that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it has not
always been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished to study
music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful
appearance at the Th¨¦atre Italien; at the same time I felt inclined to
learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in London.
This cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000 francs. I said nothing,
for we must have peace in the house; and 100,000 francs for a lady and
gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too
much. Well, you soon become tired of singing, and you take a fancy to
study diplomacy with the minister¡¯s secretary. You understand, it
signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your
own cash box. But today I find you are drawing on mine, and that your
apprenticeship may cost me 700,000 francs per month. Stop there, madame,
for this cannot last. Either the diplomatist must give his lessons
gratis, and I will tolerate him, or he must never set his foot again in
my house;¡ªdo you understand, madame?¡±

¡°Oh, this is too much,¡± cried Hermine, choking, ¡°you are worse than
despicable.¡±

¡°But,¡± continued Danglars, ¡°I find you did not even pause there¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Insults!¡±

¡°You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I
have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me
in the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash box. Be it
so. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.
Besides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the
minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the
popular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin me?¡±

¡°A probable thing!¡±

¡°Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?¡ªa false
telegraphic despatch¡ªit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be
made as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for
me¡ªI am sure of it.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said the baroness humbly, ¡°are you not aware that the man
employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with him,
that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have
been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves
that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.¡±

¡°Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a
sleepless night, which has caused the minister¡¯s secretaries to blacken
several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.¡±

¡°But, sir,¡± said Hermine suddenly, ¡°if all this is, as you say, caused
by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell
me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?¡±

¡°Do I know M. Debray?¡ªdo I wish to know him?¡ªdo I wish to know that he
gives advice?¡ªdo I wish to follow it?¡ªdo I speculate? No; you do all
this, not I.¡±

¡°Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it¡ª¡ª¡±

Danglars shrugged his shoulders. ¡°Foolish creature,¡± he exclaimed.
¡°Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three
intrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had even
hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the
commencement of the art¡ªfor generally husbands will not see¡ªyou would
then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the
women of the world. But it has not been so with me,¡ªI see, and always
have seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden
a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,
while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you
had deceived me. What has been the result?¡ªthat, thanks to my pretended
ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.
Debray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not
treated me as the master of the house,¡ªthe only title I desire with
respect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to speak
of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make me
hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above
all, I forbid you to ruin me.¡±

The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had
been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by
a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition;
she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear
the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from
some odious calculation,¡ªodious, as all his calculations were.

¡°M. de Villefort!¡ªWhat do you mean?¡±

¡°I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a
philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was
nothing to be got out of a king¡¯s attorney, died of grief or anger at
finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been enceinte
six. I am brutal,¡ªI not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of the
reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill himself
instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs to my
cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his share
of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become
bankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do¡ªdisappear.
He is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when it
is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than
he.¡±

Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to
reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of
Villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes
which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed
the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.

Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. He
shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and
returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her
half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a
disagreeable dream.






Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects

The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a
visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his coup¨¦ did not
appear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars
ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain,
watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he
should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two
o¡¯clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to
the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From
twelve to two o¡¯clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his
dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure
upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major
Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely
at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the
banker.

On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of
agitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the
ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the
Avenue des Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, No. 30.

Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged
Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was
waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abb¨¦
and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and
instead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments,
and disappeared.

A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and
Monte Cristo appeared.

¡°Pardon me,¡± said he, ¡°my dear baron, but one of my friends, the Abb¨¦
Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not
having seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave
him sooner, so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made
you wait.¡±

¡°Nay,¡± said Danglars, ¡°it is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a wrong
time, and will retire.¡±

¡°Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with
you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a
capitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to
the world.¡±

¡°I have been in ill-luck for several days,¡± said Danglars, ¡°and I have
heard nothing but bad news.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed?¡± said Monte Cristo. ¡°Have you had another fall at the
Bourse?¡±

¡°No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a
bankrupt of Trieste.¡±

¡°Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?¡±

¡°Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I
don¡¯t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during
the year. Never a mistake or delay¡ªa fellow who paid like a prince.
Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo
Manfredi suspends payment!¡±

¡°Really?¡±

¡°It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000 francs, my
bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of exchange
signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his
correspondent¡¯s in Paris at the end of this month. Today is the 30th. I
present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my
Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.¡±

¡°Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?¡±

¡°Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box¡ªnothing more!¡±

¡°Why, how could you make such a mistake¡ªsuch an old stager?¡±

¡°Oh, it is all my wife¡¯s fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to
Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she
dreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this conviction
I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she
speculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her own money, not
mine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave
the wife¡¯s pocket, the husband always finds it out. But do you mean to
say you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a tremendous
noise.¡±

¡°Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no
one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.¡±

30251m


¡°Then you do not speculate?¡±

¡°I?¡ªHow could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in
regulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep a
clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the
baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers
said something about it, did they not?¡±

¡°Then you believe the papers?¡±

¡°I?¡ªnot the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest Messager
was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced telegraphic
despatches.¡±

¡°Well, that¡¯s what puzzles me,¡± replied Danglars; ¡°the news of the
return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.¡±

¡°So that,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs
this month.¡±

¡°Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.¡±

¡°Diable!¡± said Monte Cristo compassionately, ¡°it is a hard blow for a
third-rate fortune.¡±

¡°Third-rate,¡± said Danglars, rather humble, ¡°what do you mean by that?¡±

¡°Certainly,¡± continued Monte Cristo, ¡°I make three assortments in
fortune¡ªfirst-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those
first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one¡¯s
hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as
France, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property form
a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate fortunes,
that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies,
viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000
francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally, I
call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating
capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which a
bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,
speculations of the day¡ªin fact, all operations under the influence of
greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious
capital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position,
is it not?¡±

¡°Confound it, yes!¡± replied Danglars.

¡°The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce
the third-rate house to despair.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!¡±

¡°Let us imagine seven such months,¡± continued Monte Cristo, in the same
tone. ¡°Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs
make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;¡ªwell, you are right, for
if you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your
principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man.
We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,¡ªthis is our credit;
but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on retiring
from business, you have nothing but your real principal of about five or
six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are never more than a
fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive on a railway, the
size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it. Well,
out of the five or six millions which form your real capital, you have
just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same degree
diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my simile,
your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three or
four times will cause death¡ªso pay attention to it, my dear Monsieur
Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to lend you some?¡±

30253m


¡°What a bad calculator you are!¡± exclaimed Danglars, calling to his
assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. ¡°I have made money at
the same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made up the
loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been
defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some
galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.¡±

¡°Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the
first loss.¡±

¡°No, for I am only embarked in certainties,¡± replied Danglars, with the
air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; ¡°to involve me, three
governments must crumble to dust.¡±

¡°Well, such things have been.¡±

¡°That there should be a famine!¡±

¡°Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.¡±

¡°Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and even
then my vessels would become caravans.¡±

¡°So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,¡± said
Monte Cristo; ¡°I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the class of
second-rate fortunes.¡±

¡°I think I may aspire to that honor,¡± said Danglars with a smile, which
reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond
of daubing into their pictures of ruins. ¡°But, while we are speaking of
business,¡± Danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing
the subject, ¡°tell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti.¡±

¡°Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation
seems good.¡±

¡°Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000
francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you
to me, with your endorsement¡ªof course, I immediately counted him over
the forty bank-notes.¡±

Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.

¡°But that is not all,¡± continued Danglars; ¡°he has opened an account
with my house for his son.¡±

¡°May I ask how much he allows the young man?¡±

¡°Five thousand francs per month.¡±

¡°Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing that
Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon 5,000
francs a month?¡±

¡°But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands
more¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know
these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom
were they recommended to you?¡±

¡°Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.¡±

¡°I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold to
the terms of the agreement.¡±

¡°Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°I? oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature. I was only
speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning
just now.¡±

¡°And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken him
for anything more than a mere major.¡±

¡°And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has no
manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old
lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the Italians
are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in
Oriental splendor.¡±

¡°The young man is better,¡± said Danglars.

¡°Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared
tolerable. I was uneasy about him.¡±

¡°Why?¡±

¡°Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the
world, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe tutor,
and had never been to Paris before.¡±

¡°Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?¡± asked
Danglars carelessly; ¡°they like to unite their fortunes.¡±

¡°It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing
like other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to
France to choose a wife.¡±

¡°Do you think so?¡±

¡°I am sure of it.¡±

¡°And you have heard his fortune mentioned?¡±

¡°Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and
others that he did not possess a farthing.¡±

¡°And what is your opinion?¡±

¡°I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal
impression.¡±

¡°Well, and it is that¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°My opinion is, that all these old podest¨¤s, these ancient
condottieri,¡ªfor the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed
provinces,¡ªmy opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions
in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their
eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and
the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the
florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have
become reflected in them.¡±

¡°Certainly,¡± said Danglars, ¡°and this is further supported by the fact
of their not possessing an inch of land.¡±

¡°Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,
excepting his palace in Lucca.¡±

¡°Ah, he has a palace?¡± said Danglars, laughing; ¡°come, that is
something.¡±

¡°Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while he
lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the old
fellow is very close.¡±

¡°Come, you do not flatter him.¡±

¡°I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my life;
all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was telling
me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in
Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in
France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that
though I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for
this.¡±

¡°Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a
fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of
it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is
merely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do
they give them any fortune?¡±

¡°Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as
a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons
married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married
against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month. Should
Andrea marry according to his father¡¯s views, he will, perhaps, give him
one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were the daughter
of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law
of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major takes the
key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged to live
like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling the
dice.¡±

¡°Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will
want a crown, an El Dorado, and Potos¨ª.¡±

¡°No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry
into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do
you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so
many questions?¡±

¡°Ma foi,¡± said Danglars, ¡°it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,
and you know I am a speculator.¡±

¡°You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not
like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?¡±

¡°Albert,¡± repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; ¡°ah, well; he
would care very little about it, I think.¡±

¡°But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?¡±

¡°Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame
de Morcerf and Albert¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?¡±

¡°Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de
Morcerf.¡±

¡°Mademoiselle Danglars¡¯ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if
the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.¡±

¡°Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?¡±

¡°I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being
obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.¡±

¡°Yes, yes,¡± said Danglars, laughing, ¡°it would do her a great deal of
good.¡±

¡°Why so?¡±

¡°Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.¡±

Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.

¡°But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,¡± said the
count, ¡°you must allow that he has a fine name?¡±

¡°So he has; but I like mine as well.¡±

¡°Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have
adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according
to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which
dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon
twenty years.¡±

¡°And for this very reason,¡± said Danglars with a smile, which he tried
to make sardonic, ¡°I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de
Morcerf.¡±

¡°Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°The Morcerfs!¡ªStay, my dear count,¡± said Danglars; ¡°you are a man of
the world, are you not?¡±

¡°I think so.¡±

¡°And you understand heraldry?¡±

¡°A little.¡±

¡°Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf¡¯s.¡±

¡°Why so?¡±

¡°Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least,
Danglars.¡±

¡°Well, what then?¡±

¡°While his name is not Morcerf.¡±

¡°How?¡ªnot Morcerf?¡±

¡°Not the least in the world.¡±

¡°Go on.¡±

¡°I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a
count, so that he is not one at all.¡±

¡°Impossible!¡±

¡°Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my
acquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the
most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.¡±

¡°A proof of great humility or great pride,¡± said Monte Cristo.

¡°Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.¡±

¡°And then he was called¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Fernand.¡±

¡°Only Fernand?¡±

¡°Fernand Mondego.¡±

¡°You are sure?¡±

¡°Pardieu! I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.¡±

¡°Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?¡±

¡°Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become
noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have
been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.¡±

¡°What?¡±

¡°Oh, nothing!¡±

¡°Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of
Fernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.¡±

¡°In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?¡±

¡°Exactly so.¡±

¡°This is the mystery,¡± said Danglars. ¡°I acknowledge I would have given
anything to find it out.¡±

¡°It would be very easy if you much wished it?¡±

¡°How so?¡±

¡°Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?¡±

¡°I should think so.¡±

¡°At Yanina?¡±

¡°Everywhere.¡±

¡°Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was
played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali
Tepelini.¡±

¡°You are right,¡± exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, ¡°I will write
today.¡±

¡°Do so.¡±

¡°I will.¡±

30259m


¡°And if you should hear of anything very scandalous¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I will communicate it to you.¡±

¡°You will oblige me.¡±

Danglars rushed out of the room, and made but one leap into his coup¨¦.






Chapter 67. The Office of the King¡¯s Attorney

Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and
follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at
half-past twelve o¡¯clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had
left home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the Faubourg
Saint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Passage du
Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She was very
plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in
the morning. At the Rue Gu¨¦n¨¦gaud she called a cab, and directed the
driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was seated in the
vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she
tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the bonnet, and saw with
pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and
brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed the Pont-Neuf and
entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the driver was paid as
the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon
reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.

There was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like
persons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention
to women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more
attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer.

There was a great press of people in M. de Villefort¡¯s antechamber, but
Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant
she appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether
she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment;
and on her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a private
passage to M. de Villefort¡¯s office.

The magistrate was seated in an armchair, writing, with his back towards
the door; he did not move as he heard it open, and the door-keeper
pronounce the words, ¡°Walk in, madame,¡± and then reclose it; but no
sooner had the man¡¯s footsteps ceased, than he started up, drew the
bolts, closed the curtains, and examined every corner of the room. Then,
when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard, and
was consequently relieved of doubts, he said:

¡°Thanks, madame,¡ªthanks for your punctuality;¡± and he offered a chair to
Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart beat so violently
that she felt nearly suffocated.

30261m


¡°It is a long time, madame,¡± said the procureur, describing a half-
circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite to Madame
Danglars,¡ª¡°it is a long time since I had the pleasure of speaking alone
with you, and I regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful
conversation.¡±

¡°Nevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal, although
certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for
you.¡± Villefort smiled bitterly.

¡°It is true, then,¡± he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than
addressing his companion,¡ª¡°it is true, then, that all our actions leave
their traces¡ªsome sad, others bright¡ªon our paths; it is true that every
step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands;¡ªit
leaves its track! Alas, to many the path is traced by tears.¡±

¡°Sir,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°you can feel for my emotion, can you not?
Spare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this room,¡ªwhence so many
guilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look at
that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,¡ªoh, it requires
all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman and you a
menacing judge.¡±

Villefort dropped his head and sighed.

¡°And I,¡± he said, ¡°I feel that my place is not in the judge¡¯s seat, but
on the prisoner¡¯s bench.¡±

30263m


¡°You?¡± said Madame Danglars.

¡°Yes, I.¡±

¡°I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,¡± said Madame Danglars,
whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. ¡°The paths of which you were
just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations.
Besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the indulgence of our
passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear from all this? the
world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.¡±

¡°Madame,¡± replied Villefort, ¡°you know that I am no hypocrite, or, at
least, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it
is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified,
it is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in
my youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all
seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since then
everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave
difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own free
will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me in
my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is
as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it, or from
whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a man¡¯s errors
come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then,
after error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of delirium,
or of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it. The means
we might have used, which we in our blindness could not see, then seem
simple and easy, and we say, ¡®Why did I not do this, instead of that?¡¯
Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the
decision does not come from you,¡ªyour misfortunes are generally imposed
upon you, and your faults the results of others¡¯ crimes.¡±

¡°In any case, sir, you will allow,¡± replied Madame Danglars, ¡°that, even
if the fault were alone mine, I last night received a severe punishment
for it.¡±

¡°Poor thing,¡± said Villefort, pressing her hand, ¡°it was too severe for
your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Well, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not yet
heard all.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, ¡°what is there more to hear?¡±

¡°You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough. Well,
picture to yourself a future more gloomy still¡ªcertainly frightful,
perhaps sanguinary!¡±

The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was, and his present
excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream,
but the sound died in her throat.

¡°How has this terrible past been recalled?¡± cried Villefort; ¡°how is it
that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our
hearts, where it was buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening
our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame?¡±

¡°Alas,¡± said Hermine, ¡°doubtless it is chance.¡±

¡°Chance?¡± replied Villefort; ¡°No, no, madame, there is no such thing as
chance.¡±

¡°Oh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by chance
the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by chance he
caused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the unfortunate
child was disinterred under the trees?¡ªthat poor innocent offspring of
mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many, many tears.
Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found
beneath the flowers.¡±

¡°Well, no, madame,¡ªthis is the terrible news I have to tell you,¡± said
Villefort in a hollow voice¡ª¡°no, nothing was found beneath the flowers;
there was no child disinterred¡ªno. You must not weep, no, you must not
groan, you must tremble!¡±

¡°What can you mean?¡± asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.

¡°I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found
neither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!¡±

¡°Neither of them there?¡± repeated Madame Danglars, her staring, wide-
open eyes expressing her alarm. ¡°Neither of them there!¡± she again said,
as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words
which escaped her.

¡°No,¡± said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, ¡°no, a hundred
times no!¡±

¡°Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive
me? Where did you place it? tell me¡ªwhere?¡±

¡°There! But listen to me¡ªlisten¡ªand you will pity me who has for twenty
years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,
without casting the least portion upon you.¡±

¡°Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.¡±

¡°You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed
in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,
awaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me¡ªmotionless,
breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.¡±

Madame Danglars moved rapidly, as though she would spring from her
chair, but Villefort stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore her
attention.

¡°We thought it dead,¡± he repeated; ¡°I placed it in the chest, which was
to take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole,
and then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth,
when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow
rise, and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to
cry out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I
fell lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your
sublime courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged
myself to the foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came
to meet me. We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful
catastrophe. You had the fortitude to regain the house, assisted by your
nurse. A duel was the pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely expected
it, our secret remained in our own keeping alone. I was taken to
Versailles; for three months I struggled with death; at last, as I
seemed to cling to life, I was ordered to the South. Four men carried me
from Paris to Chalons, walking six leagues a day; Madame de Villefort
followed the litter in her carriage. At Chalons I was put upon the
Sa?ne, thence I passed on to the Rh?ne, whence I descended, merely with
the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again placed on my litter, and
continued my journey to Marseilles. My recovery lasted six months. I
never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire for you. When I
returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de Nargonne, had
married M. Danglars.

¡°What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness
returned to me? Always the same¡ªalways the child¡¯s corpse, coming every
night in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave
with menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to
Paris; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had
just been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I
disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife¡¯s father and mother
should pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for
cancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given
10,000¡ªI would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the
tenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so
much wanted, I galloped to Auteuil. No one had entered the house since I
had left it.

¡°It was five o¡¯clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room, and
waited for night. There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during
my year of constant agony came back with double force. The Corsican, who
had declared the vendetta against me, who had followed me from N?mes to
Paris, who had hid himself in the garden, who had struck me, had seen me
dig the grave, had seen me inter the child,¡ªhe might become acquainted
with your person,¡ªnay, he might even then have known it. Would he not
one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret? Would it not be a
sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of
his dagger? It was therefore necessary, before everything else, and at
all risks, that I should cause all traces of the past to disappear¡ªthat
I should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always
remain in my recollection. It was for this I had annulled the lease¡ªit
was for this I had come¡ªit was for this I was waiting.

¡°Night arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a light
in that room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I
continually expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed
everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not turn
around. My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would open. At
length, one by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased. I
understood that I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor
heard, so I decided upon descending to the garden.

¡°Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I
drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found
in my coat¡ªthat little key we both used to cherish so much, which you
wished to have fastened to a golden ring¡ªwhen I opened the door, and saw
the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral
staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly
shrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I
descended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not conquer
was a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if I had
relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the lower
door. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I took it,
and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a dark
lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I
continued my path.

¡°It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had
disappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long
bony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My
terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that I
took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually
that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined
the thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully
around; I was indeed alone,¡ªno noise disturbed the silence but the owl,
whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night. I
tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the
precise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.

¡°The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when
autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where
the grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had
turned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had
been waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,
how I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some
resistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a
hole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceived¡ªhad
mistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to
recall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind
whistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my
forehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the
ground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a
laburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a
resting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,
relaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On my
right I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same attitude,
and threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and enlarging the
hole; still I found nothing, nothing¡ªthe chest was no longer there!¡±

30269m


¡°The chest no longer there?¡± murmured Madame Danglars, choking with
fear.

¡°Think not I contented myself with this one effort,¡± continued
Villefort. ¡°No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,
having discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had
intended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another
hole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea
struck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply thrown
it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my
search. I remained in the room and waited.¡±

¡°Oh, Heaven!¡±

30271m


When daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the
thicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the
darkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty
feet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in a
day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothing¡ªabsolutely
nothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,
it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this
examination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I
returned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.¡±

¡°Oh,¡± cried Madame Danglars, ¡°it was enough to drive you mad!¡±

¡°I hoped for a moment that it might,¡± said Villefort; ¡°but that
happiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,
¡®Why,¡¯ said I, ¡®should that man have carried away the corpse?¡¯¡±

¡°But you said,¡± replied Madame Danglars, ¡°he would require it as a
proof.¡±

¡°Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;
they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing
of the kind has happened.¡±

¡°What then?¡± asked Hermine, trembling violently.

¡°Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us¡ªthe child
was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!¡±

Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort¡¯s hands,
exclaimed, ¡°My child was alive?¡± said she; ¡°you buried my child alive?
You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah¡ª¡ª¡±

Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands
she wrung in her feeble grasp.

¡°I know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,¡±
replied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful
mind was on the verge of despair and madness.

¡°Ah, my child, my poor child!¡± cried the baroness, falling on her chair,
and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort, becoming somewhat
reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his
head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt.

¡°You understand, then, that if it were so,¡± said he, rising in his turn,
and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone, ¡°we are
lost. This child lives, and someone knows it lives¡ªsomeone is in
possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a
child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is
in possession of our secret.¡±

¡°Just God, avenging God!¡± murmured Madame Danglars.

Villefort¡¯s only answer was a stifled groan.

¡°But the child¡ªthe child, sir?¡± repeated the agitated mother.

¡°How I have searched for him,¡± replied Villefort, wringing his hands;
¡°how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed
for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men,
and to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for the hundredth
time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what the
Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a fugitive;
perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the
river.¡±

¡°Impossible!¡± cried Madame Danglars: ¡°a man may murder another out of
revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.¡±

¡°Perhaps,¡± continued Villefort, ¡°he had put it in the foundling
hospital.¡±

¡°Oh, yes, yes,¡± cried the baroness; ¡°my child is there!¡±

¡°I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night¡ªthe night of the
20th of September¡ªa child had been brought there, wrapped in part of a
fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the napkin
was marked with half a baron¡¯s crown, and the letter H.¡±

¡°Truly, truly,¡± said Madame Danglars, ¡°all my linen is marked thus;
Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine. Thank God, my
child was not then dead!¡±

¡°No, it was not dead.¡±

¡°And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is
the child?¡±

Villefort shrugged his shoulders.

¡°Do I know?¡± said he; ¡°and do you believe that if I knew I would relate
to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a
novel writer? Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after,
came to claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all
the requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.¡±

¡°But you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced
her.¡±

¡°And what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and employed
all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her. They
traced her to Chalons, and there they lost her.¡±

¡°They lost her?¡±

¡°Yes, forever.¡±

Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh, a tear, or a
shriek for every detail. ¡°And this is all?¡± said she; ¡°and you stopped
there?¡±

¡°Oh, no,¡± said Villefort; ¡°I never ceased to search and to inquire.
However, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.
But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since
fear urges me, not my conscience.¡±

¡°But,¡± replied Madame Danglars, ¡°the Count of Monte Cristo can know
nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.¡±

¡°Oh, the wickedness of man is very great,¡± said Villefort, ¡°since it
surpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that man¡¯s eyes while he
was speaking to us?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°But have you ever watched him carefully?¡±

¡°Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck
me,¡ªof all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched nothing.
I might have suspected he was poisoning us.¡±

¡°And you see you would have been deceived.¡±

¡°Yes, doubtless.¡±

¡°But believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I wished
to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against everyone, but
especially against him. Tell me,¡± cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more
steadfastly on her than he had ever done before, ¡°did you ever reveal to
anyone our connection?¡±

¡°Never, to anyone.¡±

¡°You understand me,¡± replied Villefort, affectionately; ¡°when I say
anyone,¡ªpardon my urgency,¡ªto anyone living I mean?¡±

¡°Yes, yes, I understand very well,¡± ejaculated the baroness; ¡°never, I
swear to you.¡±

¡°Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had
transpired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?¡±

¡°No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself.¡±

¡°Do you talk in your sleep?¡±

30275m


¡°I sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?¡±

The color mounted to the baroness¡¯s face, and Villefort turned awfully
pale.

¡°It is true,¡± said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard.

¡°Well?¡± said the baroness.

¡°Well, I understand what I now have to do,¡± replied Villefort. ¡°In less
than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte
Cristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in our
presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden.¡±

Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made
the count shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the
baroness reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the
door. Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the
other side of which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping
peacefully on his box while waiting for her.






Chapter 68. A Summer Ball

The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the
procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed
through the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the
door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son¡¯s
arm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his
toilet, drove to the Champs-¨¦lys¨¦es, to the house of Monte Cristo.

The count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing
that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man¡¯s favor. Those
who would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable
barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he
drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand.
Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice.

¡°Here I am, dear count.¡±

¡°Welcome home again.¡±

¡°I arrived an hour since.¡±

¡°From Dieppe?¡±

¡°No, from Tr¨¦port.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡±

¡°And I have come at once to see you.¡±

¡°That is extremely kind of you,¡± said Monte Cristo with a tone of
perfect indifference.

¡°And what is the news?¡±

¡°You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.¡±

¡°I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for
me?¡±

¡°Had you commissioned me?¡± said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.

¡°Come, come,¡± said Albert, ¡°do not assume so much indifference. It is
said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tr¨¦port, I felt the electric
shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.¡±

¡°Possibly,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°I have indeed thought of you, but the
magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.¡±

30277m


¡°Indeed! Pray tell me how it happened.¡±

¡°Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.¡±

¡°I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.¡±

¡°But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.¡±

¡°Your Italian prince?¡±

¡°Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.¡±

¡°Calls himself, do you say?¡±

¡°Yes, calls himself.¡±

¡°Is he not a count?¡±

¡°What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him the
same title, and everyone else does likewise.¡±

¡°What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined here?¡±

¡°Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars, M.
and Madame de Villefort,¡ªcharming people,¡ªM. Debray, Maximilian Morrel,
and M. de Chateau-Renaud.¡±

¡°Did they speak of me?¡±

¡°Not a word.¡±

¡°So much the worse.¡±

¡°Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?¡±

¡°If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am
in despair.¡±

¡°How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the
number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you at
home.¡±

¡°I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in
which I think of her.¡±

¡°Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?¡± said the count.

¡°Listen,¡± said Morcerf¡ª¡°if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take
pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with
all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to
agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a
charming mistress¡ªbut a wife¡ªdiable!¡±

¡°And this,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°is your opinion of your intended
spouse?¡±

¡°Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this
dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my
lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens
me. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,¡ªgood heavens! There she must
always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.¡±

¡°You are difficult to please, viscount.¡±

¡°Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.¡±

¡°What is that?¡±

¡°To find such a wife as my father found.¡±

Monte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some
magnificent pistols.

¡°Your father was fortunate, then?¡± said he.

¡°You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,¡ªstill beautiful,
witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with
his mother for four days at Tr¨¦port, it would have been a condescension
or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful¡ªshall I
say more poetic!¡ªthan if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my
companion.¡±

30279m


¡°That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone vow
to live a single life.¡±

¡°Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars. Have
you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain
possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at Marl¨¦¡¯s
or Fossin¡¯s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we are
compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and still must
retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we have to
endure?¡±

¡°Worldling,¡± murmured the count.

¡°Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eug¨¦nie perceives I am but a
pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has
millions.¡± Monte Cristo smiled. ¡°One plan occurred to me,¡± continued
Albert; ¡°Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in
love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written
in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: ¡®My eccentricity may
be great, but it will not make me break my promise.¡¯¡±

¡°That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one
whom you would not marry yourself.¡± Albert smiled.

¡°Apropos,¡± continued he, ¡°Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest
you; you dislike him, I think?¡±

¡°I?¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°my dear viscount, how have you discovered that
I did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.¡±

¡°And you include me in the expression everyone¡ªmany thanks!¡±

¡°Let us not mistake,¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°I love everyone as God
commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate
but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay. Did you say he was
coming?¡±

¡°Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get
Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle
Eug¨¦nie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a
grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one¡¯s
pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.¡±

¡°But M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.¡±

¡°Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie,
and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and
Madame de Villefort.¡±

¡°Which they deserve, do they not?¡±

¡°I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a
just man.¡±

¡°There is, then, one,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°whom you do not condemn like
poor Danglars?¡±

¡°Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,¡± replied
Albert, laughing.

¡°Indeed, my dear sir,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°you are revoltingly foppish.¡±

¡°I foppish? how do you mean?¡±

¡°Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle
to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course;
perhaps you may not have to retract.¡±

¡°Bah!¡± said Albert, staring.

¡°Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and
seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?¡±

¡°I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.¡±

¡°Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum
to attain the same end.¡±

¡°Am I, indeed, so happy?¡± said Albert, who still could not prevent an
almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. ¡°But, my dear count,
has M. Danglars any reason?¡±

¡°Ah! there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the self-
love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is attacked
with a needle.¡±

¡°But yet, M. Danglars appeared¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is
still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for
yourself.¡±

¡°Thank you, I understand. But my mother¡ªno, not my mother; I mistake¡ªmy
father intends giving a ball.¡±

¡°A ball at this season?¡±

¡°Summer balls are fashionable.¡±

¡°If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would
become so.¡±

¡°You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain in
Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our
invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°When will it take place?¡±

¡°On Saturday.¡±

¡°M. Cavalcanti¡¯s father will be gone.¡±

¡°But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?¡±

¡°I do not know him, viscount.¡±

¡°You do not know him?¡±

¡°No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for
him.¡±

¡°But you receive him at your house?¡±

¡°That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abb¨¦, who may
be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present
him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would
accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,¡ªbesides, I may not
be there myself.¡±

¡°Where?¡±

¡°At your ball.¡±

¡°Why should you not be there?¡±

¡°Because you have not yet invited me.¡±

¡°But I come expressly for that purpose.¡±

¡°You are very kind, but I may be prevented.¡±

¡°If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all
impediments.¡±

¡°Tell me what it is.¡±

¡°My mother begs you to come.¡±

¡°The Comtesse de Morcerf?¡± said Monte Cristo, starting.

¡°Ah, count,¡± said Albert, ¡°I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely
to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I
spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them,
for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.¡±

¡°You have talked of me?¡±

¡°Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!¡±

¡°Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too
reasonable to be led by imagination.¡±

¡°A problem, my dear count, for everyone¡ªfor my mother as well as others;
much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not fear.
My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I
believe, while the Countess G¡ª¡ª takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother
imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first
opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for
you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.¡±

¡°I thank you for the warning,¡± said the count; ¡°I shall endeavor to be
prepared for all suppositions.¡±

¡°You will, then, come on Saturday?¡±

¡°Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.¡±

¡°You are very kind.¡±

¡°Will M. Danglars be there?¡±

¡°He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the
great d¡¯Aguesseau,11 M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of
seeing him.¡±

¡°¡®Never despair of anything,¡¯ says the proverb.¡±

¡°Do you dance, count?¡±

¡°I dance?¡±

¡°Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.¡±

¡°That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I
like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?¡±

¡°Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡±

30283m


¡°Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have heard
her speak with interest.¡± Albert rose and took his hat; the count
conducted him to the door.

¡°I have one thing to reproach myself with,¡± said he, stopping Albert on
the steps. ¡°What is it?¡±

¡°I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.¡±

¡°On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.¡±

¡°I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect M.
d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡±

¡°Five or six days hence at the latest.¡±

¡°And when is he to be married?¡±

¡°Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran.¡±

¡°Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I
shall be happy to see him.¡±

¡°I will obey your orders, my lord.¡±

¡°Good-bye.¡±

¡°Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?¡±

¡°Yes, I promised you.¡± The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to him.
When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing
Bertuccio, ¡°What news?¡± said he.

¡°She went to the Palais,¡± replied the steward.

¡°Did she stay long there?¡±

¡°An hour and a half.¡±

¡°Did she return home?¡±

¡°Directly.¡±

¡°Well, my dear Bertuccio,¡± said the count, ¡°I now advise you to go in
quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.¡±

Bertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the
order he had received, he started the same evening.






Chapter 69. The Inquiry

M. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to
endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the
history of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required
information to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of
prisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter
begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely
to give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de
Villefort received the following note:

¡°The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance
of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen in Paris and
who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abb¨¦ Busoni, a
Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has done much
good.¡±

M. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made
respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the
following evening he received these details:

¡°The abb¨¦, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small two-
storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each floor
and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a dining-
room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a wainscoted
parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was evident that the
abb¨¦ limited himself to objects of strict necessity. He preferred to use
the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library than parlor, and was
furnished with theological books and parchments, in which he delighted
to bury himself for months at a time, according to his valet de chambre.
His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket; and if their
faces were unknown to him or displeased him, he replied that the abb¨¦
was not in Paris, an answer which satisfied most persons, because the
abb¨¦ was known to be a great traveller. Besides, whether at home or not,
whether in Paris or Cairo, the abb¨¦ always left something to give away,
which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master¡¯s name.
The other room near the library was a bedroom. A bed without curtains,
four armchairs, and a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet,
composed, with a prie-Dieu, all its furniture.

¡°Lord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. He was one of those
English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He hired the
apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few hours in the
day there, and rarely slept there. One of his peculiarities was never to
speak a word of French, which he however wrote with great facility.¡±

The day after this important information had been given to the king¡¯s
attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue F¨¦rou,
and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abb¨¦ Busoni were
within.

¡°No, he went out early this morning,¡± replied the valet.

¡°I might not always be content with that answer,¡± replied the visitor,
¡°for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the
kindness to give the Abb¨¦ Busoni¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I told you he was not at home,¡± repeated the valet.

¡°Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper. Will he be
at home at eight o¡¯clock this evening?¡±

¡°Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.¡±

¡°I will come again at that time,¡± replied the visitor, who then retired.

At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which,
instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue F¨¦rou, drove up to
the green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit him. From
the signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note had
produced a good effect.

¡°Is the abb¨¦ at home?¡± asked he.

¡°Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,¡± replied
the valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table,
illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while
the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the abb¨¦
in a monk¡¯s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned
men of the Middle Ages.

¡°Have I the honor of addressing the Abb¨¦ Busoni?¡± asked the visitor.

¡°Yes, sir,¡± replied the abb¨¦; ¡°and you are the person whom M. de
Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect
of police?¡±

¡°Exactly, sir.¡±

¡°One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?¡±

¡°Yes, sir¡± replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.

The abb¨¦ replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes
but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the
same. ¡°I am at your service, sir,¡± said the abb¨¦, with a marked Italian
accent.

¡°The mission with which I am charged, sir,¡± replied the visitor,
speaking with hesitation, ¡°is a confidential one on the part of him who
fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.¡± The abb¨¦ bowed. ¡°Your
probity,¡± replied the stranger, ¡°is so well known to the prefect that he
wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected
with the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to see you. It
is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce
you to conceal the truth.¡±

¡°Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my
scruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of
confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not
between me and human justice.¡±

¡°Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your conscience.¡±

At this moment the abb¨¦ pressed down his side of the shade and so raised
it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger¡¯s face, while
his own remained obscured.

¡°Excuse me, abb¨¦,¡± said the envoy of the prefect of the police, ¡°but the
light tries my eyes very much.¡± The abb¨¦ lowered the shade.

¡°Now, sir, I am listening¡ªgo on.¡±

¡°I will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte
Cristo?¡±

¡°You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?¡±

¡°Zaccone?¡ªis not his name Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not a
family name.¡±

¡°Well, be it so¡ªlet us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte
Cristo and M. Zaccone are the same¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Absolutely the same.¡±

¡°Let us speak of M. Zaccone.¡±

¡°Agreed.¡±

¡°I asked you if you knew him?¡±

¡°Extremely well.¡±

¡°Who is he?¡±

¡°The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.¡±

¡°I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not
content itself with vague reports.¡±

¡°However,¡± replied the abb¨¦, with an affable smile, ¡°when that report is
in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police as
well as all the rest.¡±

¡°Are you sure of what you assert?¡±

¡°What do you mean by that question?¡±

¡°Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if
you are certain of it?¡±

¡°I knew his father, M. Zaccone.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed?¡±

¡°And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.¡±

¡°But whence does he derive the title of count?¡±

¡°You are aware that may be bought.¡±

¡°In Italy?¡±

¡°Everywhere.¡±

¡°And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?¡±

¡°They may not be so very great.¡±

¡°How much do you suppose he possesses?¡±

¡°From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.¡±

¡°That is reasonable,¡± said the visitor; ¡°I have heard he had three or
four millions.¡±

¡°Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.¡±

¡°But I was told he had four millions per annum.¡±

¡°That is not probable.¡±

¡°Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°Certainly, everyone who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to
France by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must
have seen it.¡±

¡°I am told it is a delightful place?¡±

¡°It is a rock.¡±

¡°And why has the count bought a rock?¡±

¡°For the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial
possessions to be a count.¡±

¡°You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone¡¯s youth?¡±

¡°The father¡¯s?¡±

¡°No, the son¡¯s.¡±

¡°I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my
young comrade.¡±

¡°Was he in the wars?¡±

¡°I think he entered the service.¡±

¡°In what branch?¡±

¡°In the navy.¡±

¡°Are you not his confessor?¡±

¡°No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.¡±

¡°A Lutheran?¡±

¡°I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides, liberty
of conscience is established in France.¡±

¡°Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his
actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know
of him.

¡°He passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has
made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the
Christians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from
Eastern monarchs of his services.¡±

¡°Does he wear them?¡±

¡°No, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given to
the benefactors of man than to his destroyers.¡±

¡°He is a Quaker then?¡±

¡°Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.¡±

¡°Has he any friends?¡±

¡°Yes, everyone who knows him is his friend.¡±

¡°But has he any enemies?¡±

¡°One only.¡±

¡°What is his name?¡±

¡°Lord Wilmore.¡±

¡°Where is he?¡±

¡°He is in Paris just now.¡±

¡°Can he give me any particulars?¡±

¡°Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone.¡±

¡°Do you know his abode?¡±

¡°It¡¯s somewhere in the Chauss¨¦e d¡¯Antin; but I know neither the street
nor the number.¡±

30289m


¡°Are you at variance with the Englishman?¡±

¡°I love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.¡±

¡°Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before
he made this visit to Paris?¡±

¡°To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because
he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and as
I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.
Cavalcanti to him.¡±

¡°Andrea?¡±

¡°No, Bartolomeo, his father.¡±

¡°Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in the
name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.¡±

¡°What is it, sir?¡±

¡°Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at
Auteuil?¡±

¡°Certainly, for he told me.¡±

¡°What is it, sir?¡±

¡°To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count of
Pisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?¡±

¡°I have heard of it.¡±

¡°It is a magnificent charity.¡± Having said this, the abb¨¦ bowed to imply
he wished to pursue his studies.

The visitor either understood the abb¨¦¡¯s meaning, or had no more
questions to ask; he arose, and the abb¨¦ accompanied him to the door.

¡°You are a great almsgiver,¡± said the visitor, ¡°and although you are
said to be rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor
people; will you accept my offering?¡±

¡°I thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the
relief I give should be entirely from my own resources.¡±

¡°However¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for
yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to
exercise your benevolence.¡±

The abb¨¦ once more bowed as he opened the door, the stranger bowed and
took his leave, and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of
M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered, and
this time it went to the Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges, and stopped at No.
5, where Lord Wilmore lived. The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore,
requesting an interview, which the latter had fixed for ten o¡¯clock. As
the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten, he
was told that Lord Wilmore, who was precision and punctuality
personified, was not yet come in, but that he would be sure to return as
the clock struck.

The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all
other furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern S¨¨vres
vases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with
an engraving on each side¡ªone representing Homer carrying his guide, the
other, Belisarius begging¡ªa grayish paper; red and black tapestry¡ªsuch
was the appearance of Lord Wilmore¡¯s drawing-room.

It was illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a
feeble light, as if out of consideration for the envoy¡¯s weak sight.
After ten minutes¡¯ expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke
the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above the
middle height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light
hair, turning rather gray. He was dressed with all the English
peculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar,
in the fashion of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen
pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps
from slipping up to the knee. His first remark on entering was:

¡°You know, sir, I do not speak French?¡±

¡°I know you do not like to converse in our language,¡± replied the envoy.

¡°But you may use it,¡± replied Lord Wilmore; ¡°I understand it.¡±

¡°And I,¡± replied the visitor, changing his idiom, ¡°know enough of
English to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the
slightest inconvenience.¡±

¡°Aw?¡± said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives
of Great Britain.

The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read
with English coolness, and having finished:

¡°I understand,¡± said he, ¡°perfectly.¡±

30293m


Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been
addressed to the Abb¨¦ Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of
the count¡¯s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more
numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten
years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of
India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met
him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken
prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had
escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;
then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the
Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in
the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from
everyone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was
consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,
which was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord
Wilmore¡¯s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum,¡ªa
precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the failure of
the mine.

¡°But,¡± asked the visitor, ¡°do you know why he came to France?¡±

¡°He is speculating in railways,¡± said Lord Wilmore, ¡°and as he is an
expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of
telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.¡±

¡°How much does he spend yearly?¡± asked the prefect.

¡°Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,¡± said Lord Wilmore;
¡°he is a miser.¡± Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing
no other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.

¡°Do you know his house at Auteuil?¡±

¡°Certainly.¡±

¡°What do you know respecting it?¡±

¡°Do you wish to know why he bought it?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in
experiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he
has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagn¨¨res, Luchon, and
Cauterets. He is going to turn his house into a Badhaus, as the Germans
term it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find
the famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon purchase all
the contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his railway, his
electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin him, I am
watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.¡±

¡°What was the cause of your quarrel?¡±

¡°When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.¡±

¡°Why do you not seek revenge?¡±

¡°I have already fought three duels with him,¡± said the Englishman, ¡°the
first with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with the
sabre.¡±

¡°And what was the result of those duels?¡±

¡°The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the
breast; and the third time, made this large wound.¡± The Englishman
turned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved it
to be a recent one. ¡°So that, you see, there is a deadly feud between
us.¡±

¡°But,¡± said the envoy, ¡°you do not go about it in the right way to kill
him, if I understand you correctly.¡±

¡°Aw?¡± said the Englishman, ¡°I practice shooting every day, and every
other day Grisier comes to my house.¡±

This was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the
Englishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord
Wilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the
English, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after
him, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his
light hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume
the black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte
Cristo.

It was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the house
of M. de Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he had
learned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since the
dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.






Chapter 70. The Ball

It was in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the
Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de
Morcerf¡¯s. It was ten o¡¯clock at night; the branches of the great trees
in the garden of the count¡¯s house stood out boldly against the azure
canopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where the
last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered.

From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of
music, with the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams of
light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this moment
the garden was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just
received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity
of the weather continuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided
whether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long
tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with
stars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn.

The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the
Italian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the
table¡ªthe rarest of all luxuries in their complete form¡ªare well
understood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers.

30297m


At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
count; for, owing to the good taste of Merc¨¦d¨¨s, one was sure of finding
some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying
in case of need.

Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had caused deep
anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf¡¯s, when during
the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort. The latter
made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together, said:

¡°You are going to Madame de Morcerf¡¯s, are you not?¡±

¡°No,¡± replied Madame Danglars, ¡°I am too ill.¡±

¡°You are wrong,¡± replied Villefort, significantly; ¡°it is important that
you should be seen there.¡±

¡°Do you think so?¡± asked the baroness.

¡°I do.¡±

¡°In that case I will go.¡±

And the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations.
Madame Danglars therefore came, not only beautiful in person, but
radiant with splendor; she entered by one door at the time when Merc¨¦d¨¨s
appeared at the door. The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars.
He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet, and
offered his arm to conduct her to a seat. Albert looked around him.

¡°You are looking for my daughter?¡± said the baroness, smiling.

¡°I confess it,¡± replied Albert. ¡°Could you have been so cruel as not to
bring her?¡±

¡°Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken her
arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Well, what do you wish to know?¡±

¡°Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight?¡±

¡°Seventeen!¡± replied Albert.

¡°What do you mean?¡±

¡°I only mean that the count seems the rage,¡± replied the viscount,
smiling, ¡°and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the
same question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.¡±

¡°And have you replied to everyone as you have to me?¡±

¡°Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have
this ¡®lion¡¯; we are among the privileged ones.¡±

¡°Were you at the Opera yesterday?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°He was there.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?¡±

¡°Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in Le Diable
boiteux; the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he
placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to the
charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift,
reappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,¡ªwill she be
here?¡±

¡°No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the count¡¯s
establishment is not sufficiently understood.¡±

¡°Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is
trying to attract your attention.¡±

Albert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de
Villefort, whose lips opened as he approached.

¡°I wager anything,¡± said Albert, interrupting her, ¡°that I know what you
were about to say.¡±

¡°Well, what is it?¡±

¡°If I guess rightly, will you confess it?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°On your honor?¡±

¡°On my honor.¡±

¡°You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or
was expected.¡±

¡°Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to ask
you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.¡±

¡°Yes,¡ªyesterday.¡±

¡°What did he tell you?¡±

¡°That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.¡±

¡°Well, now then, the count?¡±

¡°The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.¡±

¡°You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?¡±

¡°No, I did not know it.¡±

¡°Monte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.¡±

¡°I never heard it.¡±

¡°Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.¡±

¡°It is possible.¡±

¡°He is a Maltese.¡±

¡°That is also possible.

¡°The son of a shipowner.¡±

¡°Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest
success.¡±

¡°He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris
to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.¡±

¡°Well, I¡¯m sure,¡± said Morcerf, ¡°this is indeed news! Am I allowed to
repeat it?¡±

¡°Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told
you.¡±

¡°Why so?¡±

¡°Because it is a secret just discovered.¡±

¡°By whom?¡±

¡°The police.¡±

¡°Then the news originated¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°At the prefect¡¯s last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished
at the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made
inquiries.¡±

¡°Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a
vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.¡±

¡°Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not
been so favorable.¡±

¡°Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?¡±

¡°I think not.¡±

¡°Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will
not fail to do so.¡±

Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and
glossy moustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert
extended his hand.

¡°Madame,¡± said Albert, ¡°allow me to present to you M. Maximilian Morrel,
captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all, of our bravest
officers.¡±

¡°I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil,
at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,¡± replied Madame de Villefort,
turning away with marked coldness of manner.

This answer, and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled
the heart of poor Morrel. But a recompense was in store for him; turning
around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large blue
eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while the
bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips.

The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same
expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these
two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble
aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room,
forgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their
mutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one
another, without anyone noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte
Cristo had just entered.

We have already said that there was something in the count which
attracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the coat,
unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the
plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot
so perfectly formed¡ªit was none of these things that attracted the
attention,¡ªit was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm
and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled
with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high
disdain,¡ªthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him.

Many men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none
whose appearance was more significant, if the expression may be used.
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant
habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to
the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture,
scarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that
even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected
with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.

30301m


Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery
of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a
mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a
looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him.
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was
bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her, while
on his side the count thought she was about to address him; but both
remained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his steps
to Albert, who received him cordially.

¡°Have you seen my mother?¡± asked Albert.

¡°I have just had the pleasure,¡± replied the count; ¡°but I have not seen
your father.¡±

¡°See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of great
geniuses.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°and so those gentlemen down there are men
of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of
talent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.¡±

¡°That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the
neighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards
usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the
Institute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided
in his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the
learned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion of
Honor, was made an officer.¡±

¡°Come,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded.
I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they would have
made him a commander.¡±

¡°Very likely,¡± said Albert.

¡°And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap
himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?¡±

¡°Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic¡¯s, which deputed
David12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡± said Monte Cristo; ¡°so this gentleman is an Academician?¡±

¡°Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.¡±

¡°And what is his especial talent?¡±

¡°His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he
makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with
whalebone.¡±

¡°And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?¡±

¡°No; of the French Academy.¡±

¡°But what has the French Academy to do with all this?¡±

¡°I was going to tell you. It seems¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of
science, doubtless?¡±

¡°No; that his style of writing is very good.¡±

¡°This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose
heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and
to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?¡±

Albert laughed.

¡°And the other one?¡± demanded the count.

¡°That one?¡±

¡°Yes, the third.¡±

¡°The one in the dark blue coat?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to
the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was very
successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal papers,
but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him
into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an ambassador.¡±

30303m


¡°And what are his claims to the peerage?¡±

¡°He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five
articles in the Si¨¨cle, and voted five or six years on the ministerial
side.¡±

¡°Bravo, viscount,¡± said Monte Cristo, smiling; ¡°you are a delightful
cicerone. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?¡±

¡°What is it?¡±

¡°Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it,
you will warn me.¡± Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He turned
round; it was Danglars.

¡°Ah! is it you, baron?¡± said he.

¡°Why do you call me baron?¡± said Danglars; ¡°you know that I care nothing
for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you
not?¡±

¡°Certainly,¡± replied Albert, ¡°seeing that without my title I should be
nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the
millionaire.¡±

¡°Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,¡± replied
Danglars.

¡°Unfortunately,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°one¡¯s title to a millionaire does
not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;
for example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have
just become bankrupts.¡±

¡°Indeed?¡± said Danglars, becoming pale.

¡°Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a
million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago.¡±

¡°Ah, mon Dieu!¡± exclaimed Danglars, ¡°they have drawn on me for 200,000
francs!¡±

¡°Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per
cent.¡±

¡°Yes, but it is too late,¡± said Danglars, ¡°I have honored their bills.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said Monte Cristo, ¡°here are 200,000 francs gone after¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Hush, do not mention these things,¡± said Danglars; then, approaching
Monte Cristo, he added, ¡°especially before young M. Cavalcanti;¡± after
which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question.

Albert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse
with young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile
the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms
with waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from
his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he
took no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte
Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of
refusal.

¡°Albert,¡± she asked, ¡°did you notice that?¡±

¡°What, mother?¡±

¡°That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof
of M. de Morcerf.¡±

¡°Yes; but then he breakfasted with me¡ªindeed, he made his first
appearance in the world on that occasion.¡±

¡°But your house is not M. de Morcerf¡¯s,¡± murmured Merc¨¦d¨¨s; ¡°and since
he has been here I have watched him.¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°Well, he has taken nothing yet.¡±

¡°The count is very temperate.¡±

Merc¨¦d¨¨s smiled sadly.

¡°Approach him,¡± said she, ¡°and when the next waiter passes, insist upon
his taking something.¡±

¡°But why, mother?¡±

¡°Just to please me, Albert,¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s. Albert kissed his mother¡¯s
hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the
preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he
obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale.

¡°Well,¡± said she, ¡°you see he refuses?¡±

¡°Yes; but why need this annoy you?¡±

¡°You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have
seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he
cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer
something else.¡±

¡°Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does
not feel inclined this evening.¡±

¡°And besides,¡± said the countess, ¡°accustomed as he is to burning
climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.¡±

¡°I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost
suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as
the windows.¡±

¡°In a word,¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s, ¡°it was a way of assuring me that his
abstinence was intended.¡±

And she left the room.

A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the
jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden
ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent. Dancers,
players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy¡ªeveryone inhaled
with delight the breeze that floated in. At the same time Merc¨¦d¨¨s
reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable expression of
countenance which she sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of
which her husband formed the centre.

¡°Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,¡± she said; ¡°they would
prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate
here, since they are not playing.¡±

¡°Ah,¡± said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung Partant pour la
Syrie,¡ª¡°we will not go alone to the garden.¡±

¡°Then,¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s, ¡°I will lead the way.¡±

Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, ¡°count, will you oblige me with
your arm?¡±

The count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes
on Merc¨¦d¨¨s. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the
countess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that one
look. He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just
touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the steps,
lined with rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another outlet,
a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud
exclamations of delight.






Chapter 71. Bread and Salt

Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It led
through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.

¡°It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?¡± she asked.

¡°Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors
and the blinds.¡± As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of
Merc¨¦d¨¨s tremble. ¡°But you,¡± he said, ¡°with that light dress, and
without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel
cold?¡±

¡°Do you know where I am leading you?¡± said the countess, without
replying to the question.

¡°No, madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo; ¡°but you see I make no resistance.¡±

¡°We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the
grove.¡±

The count looked at Merc¨¦d¨¨s as if to interrogate her, but she continued
to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They reached the
building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the
beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of
the sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess left the arm
of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.

¡°See, count,¡± she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one
could almost detect the tears on her eyelids¡ª¡°see, our French grapes are
not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you
will make allowance for our northern sun.¡± The count bowed, but stepped
back.

¡°Do you refuse?¡± said Merc¨¦d¨¨s, in a tremulous voice.

¡°Pray excuse me, madame,¡± replied Monte Cristo, ¡°but I never eat
Muscatel grapes.¡±

Merc¨¦d¨¨s let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging
against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat. Merc¨¦d¨¨s
drew near, and plucked the fruit.

¡°Take this peach, then,¡± she said. The count again refused. ¡°What,
again?¡± she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to
stifle a sob; ¡°really, you pain me.¡±

A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the ground.

¡°Count,¡± added Merc¨¦d¨¨s with a supplicating glance, ¡°there is a
beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have
together eaten bread and salt under the same roof.¡±

¡°I know it, madame,¡± replied the count; ¡°but we are in France, and not
in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom
of dividing bread and salt with one another.¡±

¡°But,¡± said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte
Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, ¡°we are
friends, are we not?¡±

The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then
again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of
a man suddenly dazzled.

¡°Certainly, we are friends,¡± he replied; ¡°why should we not be?¡±

The answer was so little like the one Merc¨¦d¨¨s desired, that she turned
away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more like a groan. ¡°Thank
you,¡± she said. And they walked on again. They went the whole length of
the garden without uttering a word.

¡°Sir,¡± suddenly exclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued
ten minutes in silence, ¡°is it true that you have seen so much,
travelled so far, and suffered so deeply?¡±

¡°I have suffered deeply, madame,¡± answered Monte Cristo.

¡°But now you are happy?¡±

¡°Doubtless,¡± replied the count, ¡°since no one hears me complain.¡±

¡°And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?¡±

¡°My present happiness equals my past misery,¡± said the count.

¡°Are you not married?¡± asked the countess.

¡°I, married?¡± exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; ¡°who could have told
you so?¡±

¡°No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the Opera
with a young and lovely woman.¡±

¡°She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter of
a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to love
in the world.¡±

¡°You live alone, then?¡±

¡°I do.¡±

¡°You have no sister¡ªno son¡ªno father?¡±

¡°I have no one.¡±

¡°How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?¡±

¡°It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the
point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she
loved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my
memory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most men
who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker than
the hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have done in
my place; that is all.¡±

The countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping for breath. ¡°Yes,¡± she
said, ¡°and you have still preserved this love in your heart¡ªone can only
love once¡ªand did you ever see her again?¡±

30309m


¡°Never.¡±

¡°Never?¡±

¡°I never returned to the country where she lived.¡±

¡°To Malta?¡±

¡°Yes; Malta.¡±

¡°She is, then, now at Malta?¡±

¡°I think so.¡±

¡°And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?¡±

¡°Her,¡ªyes.¡±

¡°But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?¡±

¡°I hate them? Not at all; why should I?¡± The countess placed herself
before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed
grapes.

¡°Take some,¡± she said.

¡°Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,¡± replied Monte Cristo, as if the
subject had not been mentioned before. The countess dashed the grapes
into the nearest thicket, with a gesture of despair.

¡°Inflexible man!¡± she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if
the reproach had not been addressed to him.

Albert at this moment ran in. ¡°Oh, mother,¡± he exclaimed, ¡°such a
misfortune has happened!¡±

¡°What? What has happened?¡± asked the countess, as though awakening from
a sleep to the realities of life; ¡°did you say a misfortune? Indeed, I
should expect misfortunes.¡±

¡°M. de Villefort is here.¡±

¡°Well?¡±

¡°He comes to fetch his wife and daughter.¡±

¡°Why so?¡±

¡°Because Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the
news of M. de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s death, which took place on the first stage
after he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good
spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but
Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,
notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her
like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.¡±

¡°And how was M. de Saint-M¨¦ran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?¡±
said the count.

¡°He was her grandfather on the mother¡¯s side. He was coming here to
hasten her marriage with Franz.¡±

¡°Ah, indeed!¡±

¡°So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-M¨¦ran also grandfather to
Mademoiselle Danglars?¡±

¡°Albert, Albert,¡± said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof,
¡°what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him that
he has spoken amiss.¡±

And she took two or three steps forward. Monte Cristo watched her with
an air so thoughtful, and so full of affectionate admiration, that she
turned back and grasped his hand; at the same time she seized that of
her son, and joined them together.

¡°We are friends; are we not?¡± she asked.

¡°Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all
times I am your most respectful servant.¡± The countess left with an
indescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the
count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes.

¡°Do not my mother and you agree?¡± asked Albert, astonished.

¡°On the contrary,¡± replied the count, ¡°did you not hear her declare that
we were friends?¡±

They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and Madame de
Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel
departed almost at the same time.






Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran

A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.
After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties
of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them,
the procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his custom,
with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else, but which
generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires.

But this time the papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had
secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door locked
and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important
business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the
events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled
his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections.

Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him,
he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a
parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged,
in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either
in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his
mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies.

Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet
these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile
with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from
the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the
almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so
perilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his memory,
again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his lists, he
shook his head.

¡°No,¡± he murmured, ¡°none of my enemies would have waited so patiently
and laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might now come
and crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says:

¡®Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o¡¯erwhelm them, to men¡¯s
eyes;¡¯ but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story
has been told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has
repeated it. M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten
himself¡ª¡ª

¡°But why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?¡± asked
Villefort, after a moment¡¯s reflection, ¡°what interest can this M. de
Monte Cristo or M. Zaccone,¡ªson of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer of a
mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,¡ªwhat interest,
I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and useless fact
like this? However, among all the incoherent details given to me by the
Abb¨¦ Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that enemy, one
thing appears certain and clear in my opinion¡ªthat in no period, in no
case, in no circumstance, could there have been any contact between him
and me.¡±

But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He
dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its
truth;¡ªhe cared little for that mene, mene, tekel upharsin, which
appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;¡ªbut what he was
really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them. While he
was endeavoring to calm his fears,¡ªand instead of dwelling upon the
political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious
dreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in
fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,¡ªthe noise of a
carriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person
ascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as
servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in
their master¡¯s grief.

He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost directly an old lady
entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm, and her bonnet in
her hand. The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead, and
her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost disappeared
beneath the eyelids swollen with grief.

¡°Oh, sir,¡± she said; ¡°oh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it; oh,
yes, I shall certainly die of it!¡±

And then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a
paroxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to
approach nearer, were looking at Noirtier¡¯s old servant, who had heard
the noise from his master¡¯s room, and run there also, remaining behind
the others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it
was she.

¡°Why, what can have happened?¡± he exclaimed, ¡°what has thus disturbed
you? Is M. de Saint-M¨¦ran with you?¡±

¡°M. de Saint-M¨¦ran is dead,¡± answered the old marchioness, without
preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. Villefort
drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed:

¡°Dead!¡ªso suddenly?¡±

¡°A week ago,¡± continued Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, ¡°we went out together in
the carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-M¨¦ran had been unwell for some
days; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him
with courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave. At six
leagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is
accustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to
me unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that his
face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more
violently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer
see, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from a
person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back
violently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M. de
Saint-M¨¦ran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I
arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.¡±

Villefort stood with his mouth half open, quite stupefied.

¡°Of course you sent for a doctor?¡±

¡°Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.¡±

¡°Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had
died.¡±

¡°Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic
stroke.¡±

¡°And what did you do then?¡±

¡°M. de Saint-M¨¦ran had always expressed a desire, in case his death
happened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought
to the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am
preceding him by a few days.¡±

¡°Oh! my poor mother!¡± said Villefort, ¡°to have such duties to perform at
your age after such a blow!¡±

¡°God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would
certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It is
true that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot cry;
at my age they say that we have no more tears,¡ªstill I think that when
one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where is
Valentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see
Valentine.¡±

30315m


Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a
ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her step-mother, and
that she should be fetched. ¡°This instant, sir¡ªthis instant, I beseech
you!¡± said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm of Madame de Saint-
M¨¦ran within his own, and conducted her to his apartment.

¡°Rest yourself, mother,¡± he said.

The marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who
so forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still lived
for her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and
bursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an armchair, where she
buried her venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the women,
while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing frightens
old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a
moment in order to strike some other old person. Then, while Madame de
Saint-M¨¦ran remained on her knees, praying fervently, Villefort sent for
a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de
Morcerf¡¯s. He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball-room,
that Valentine ran to him, saying:

¡°Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!¡±

¡°Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,¡± said M. de Villefort.

¡°And grandpapa?¡± inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. It was
just in time, for Valentine¡¯s head swam, and she staggered; Madame de
Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her husband in
dragging her to the carriage, saying:

¡°What a singular event! Who could have thought it? Ah, yes, it is indeed
strange!¡±

And the wretched family departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging
over the rest of the evening. At the foot of the stairs, Valentine found
Barrois awaiting her.

¡°M. Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.

¡°Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,¡± she replied,
feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the
most service just then was Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran.

Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung
sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad
interview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband¡¯s arm,
maintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor
widow. She soon whispered to her husband:

¡°I think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for
the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.¡± Madame de
Saint-M¨¦ran heard her.

¡°Yes, yes,¡± she said softly to Valentine, ¡°let her leave; but do you
stay.¡±

Madame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed,
for the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death,
had followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first
time to old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as
we have said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return,
his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger.

¡°Alas, sir,¡± exclaimed Barrois, ¡°a great misfortune has happened. Madame
de Saint-M¨¦ran has arrived, and her husband is dead!¡±

M. de Saint-M¨¦ran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of
friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects
another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently
overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry.

Barrois asked, ¡°Mademoiselle Valentine?¡±

Noirtier nodded his head.

¡°She is at the ball, as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you
in full dress.¡± Noirtier again closed his left eye.

¡°Do you wish to see her?¡± Noirtier again made an affirmative sign.

¡°Well, they have gone to fetch her, no doubt, from Madame de Morcerf¡¯s;
I will await her return, and beg her to come up here. Is that what you
wish for?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± replied the invalid.

Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed
her of her grandfather¡¯s wish. Consequently, Valentine came up to
Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, who in the midst of her
grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a
bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have
said, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier.

Valentine kissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness
that her eyes again filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be
exhausted. The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same
expression.

¡°Yes, yes,¡± said Valentine, ¡°you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather
left, do you not.¡± The old man intimated that such was his meaning. ¡°Ah,
yes, happily I have,¡± replied Valentine. ¡°Without that, what would
become of me?¡±

It was one o¡¯clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed
himself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of
rest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his
child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her
appear quite ill.

The next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the fever had not
abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be
suffering from violent nervous irritability.

¡°Oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?¡± exclaimed Valentine, perceiving
all these signs of agitation.

¡°No, my child, no,¡± said Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran; ¡°but I was impatiently
waiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.¡±

¡°My father?¡± inquired Valentine, uneasily.

¡°Yes, I wish to speak to him.¡±

Valentine durst not oppose her grandmother¡¯s wish, the cause of which
she did not know, and an instant afterwards Villefort entered.

¡°Sir,¡± said Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, without using any circumlocution, and
as if fearing she had no time to lose, ¡°you wrote to me concerning the
marriage of this child?¡±

¡°Yes, madame,¡± replied Villefort, ¡°it is not only projected but
arranged.¡±

¡°Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡±

¡°Yes, madame.¡±

¡°Is he not the son of General d¡¯¨¦pinay who was on our side, and who was
assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of
Elba?¡±

¡°The same.¡±

¡°Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a
Jacobin?¡±

¡°Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,¡± said
Villefort; ¡°M. d¡¯¨¦pinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows
very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with pleasure, at
least with indifference.¡±

¡°Is it a suitable match?¡±

¡°In every respect.¡±

¡°And the young man?¡±

¡°Is regarded with universal esteem.¡±

¡°You approve of him?¡±

¡°He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.¡±

During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent.

¡°Well, sir,¡± said Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, after a few minutes¡¯
reflection, ¡°I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to
live.¡±

¡°You, madame?¡± ¡°You, dear mamma?¡± exclaimed M. de Villefort and
Valentine at the same time.

¡°I know what I am saying,¡± continued the marchioness; ¡°I must hurry you,
so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother to
bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor
Ren¨¦e, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.¡±

¡°Ah, madame,¡± said Villefort, ¡°you forget that I was obliged to give a
mother to my child.¡±

¡°A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the
purpose,¡ªour business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in
peace.¡±

All this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was something
in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium.

¡°It shall be as you wish, madame,¡± said Villefort; ¡°more especially
since your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d¡¯¨¦pinay arrives
in Paris¡ª¡ª¡±

30319m


¡°My dear grandmother,¡± interrupted Valentine, ¡°consider decorum¡ªthe
recent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?¡±

¡°My child,¡± exclaimed the old lady sharply, ¡°let us hear none of the
conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the
future. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly
I have not been less happy on that account.¡±

¡°Still that idea of death, madame,¡± said Villefort.

¡°Still?¡ªAlways! I tell you I am going to die¡ªdo you understand? Well,
before dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make my
child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey
me;¡ªin fact, I will know him¡ªI will!¡± continued the old lady, with a
fearful expression, ¡°that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find
him, if he should not fulfil his duty!¡±

¡°Madame,¡± said Villefort, ¡°you must lay aside these exalted ideas, which
almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in their
graves, rise no more.¡±

¡°And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a
fearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my
body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what
will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut,
in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where
there is a door leading into Madame Villefort¡¯s dressing-room¡ªI saw, I
tell you, silently enter, a white figure.¡±

Valentine screamed.

¡°It was the fever that disturbed you, madame,¡± said Villefort.

30321m


¡°Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white
figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one
of my senses, I heard my glass removed¡ªthe same which is there now on
the table.¡±

¡°Oh, dear mother, it was a dream.¡±

¡°So little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the bell;
but when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a
light.¡±

¡°But she saw no one?¡±

¡°Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was the
soul of my husband!¡ªWell, if my husband¡¯s soul can come to me, why
should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is even
more direct, it seems to me.¡±

¡°Oh, madame,¡± said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, ¡°do
not yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy,
loved, and honored, and we will make you forget¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Never, never, never,¡± said the marchioness. ¡°When does M. d¡¯¨¦pinay
return?¡±

¡°We expect him every moment.¡±

¡°It is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be expeditious.
And then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all our
property returns to Valentine.¡±

¡°Ah, grandmamma,¡± murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the burning
brow, ¡°do you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we must not
send for a notary, but for a doctor!¡±

¡°A doctor?¡± said she, shrugging her shoulders, ¡°I am not ill; I am
thirsty¡ªthat is all.¡±

30323m


¡°What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?¡±

¡°The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table¡ªgive it to
me, Valentine.¡± Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it
to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same
glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre.

The marchioness drained the glass at a single draught, and then turned
on her pillow, repeating,

¡°The notary, the notary!¡±

M. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the
bedside of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require
the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot
burned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her
pulse beat with feverish excitement. She was thinking of the despair of
Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran,
instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy.

More than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she
would not have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named
Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de Chateau-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian
extraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de Saint-M¨¦ran
despised all who were not noble. Her secret had each time been repressed
when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction that it would be
useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her father and mother,
all would be lost.

Two hours passed thus; Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran was in a feverish sleep,
and the notary had arrived. Though his coming was announced in a very
low tone, Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran arose from her pillow.

¡°The notary!¡± she exclaimed, ¡°let him come in.¡±

The notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. ¡°Go, Valentine,¡±
said Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, ¡°and leave me with this gentleman.¡±

¡°But, grandmamma¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Leave me¡ªgo!¡±

The young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her handkerchief to
her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre, who told her that
the doctor was waiting in the dining-room. Valentine instantly ran down.
The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one of the
cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose birth he had
witnessed. He had himself a daughter about her age, but whose life was
one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having
been consumptive.

¡°Oh,¡± said Valentine, ¡°we have been waiting for you with such
impatience, dear M. d¡¯Avrigny. But, first of all, how are Madeleine and
Antoinette?¡±

Madeleine was the daughter of M. d¡¯Avrigny, and Antoinette his niece. M.
d¡¯Avrigny smiled sadly.

¡°Antoinette is very well,¡± he said, ¡°and Madeleine tolerably so. But you
sent for me, my dear child. It is not your father or Madame de Villefort
who is ill. As for you, although we doctors cannot divest our patients
of nerves, I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you
not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field.¡±

Valentine colored. M. d¡¯Avrigny carried the science of divination almost
to a miraculous extent, for he was one of the physicians who always work
upon the body through the mind.

30325m


¡°No,¡± she replied, ¡°it is for my poor grandmother. You know the calamity
that has happened to us, do you not?¡±

¡°I know nothing.¡± said M. d¡¯Avrigny.

¡°Alas,¡± said Valentine, restraining her tears, ¡°my grandfather is dead.¡±

¡°M. de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Suddenly?¡±

¡°From an apoplectic stroke.¡±

¡°An apoplectic stroke?¡± repeated the doctor.

¡°Yes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she never
left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M.
d¡¯Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!¡±

¡°Where is she?¡±

¡°In her room with the notary.¡±

¡°And M. Noirtier?¡±

¡°Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of
moving or speaking.¡±

¡°And the same love for you¡ªeh, my dear child?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Valentine, ¡°he was very fond of me.¡±

¡°Who does not love you?¡± Valentine smiled sadly. ¡°What are your
grandmother¡¯s symptoms?¡±

¡°An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she
fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her
body, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium;
she fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even
heard the noise it made on touching her glass.¡±

¡°It is singular,¡± said the doctor; ¡°I was not aware that Madame de
Saint-M¨¦ran was subject to such hallucinations.¡±

¡°It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,¡± said Valentine;
¡°and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad; and my
father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself appeared deeply
impressed.¡±

¡°We will go and see,¡± said the doctor; ¡°what you tell me seems very
strange.¡± The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that her
grandmother was alone.

¡°Go upstairs,¡± she said to the doctor.

¡°And you?¡±

¡°Oh, I dare not¡ªshe forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am
myself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn in
the garden to recover myself.¡±

The doctor pressed Valentine¡¯s hand, and while he visited her
grandmother, she descended the steps. We need not say which portion of
the garden was her favorite walk. After remaining for a short time in
the parterre surrounding the house, and gathering a rose to place in her
waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench;
then from the bench she went to the gate. As usual, Valentine strolled
for a short time among her flowers, but without gathering them. The
mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament, though
she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe.

30327m


She then turned towards the avenue. As she advanced she fancied she
heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped astonished, then the voice
reached her ear more distinctly, and she recognized it to be that of
Maximilian.






Chapter 73. The Promise

It was indeed Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence
since the previous day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had
anticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran and the death of
the marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefort¡¯s in
connection with his attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were
realized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him
pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees.

Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as
it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the
spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her,
and she ran to the gate.

¡°You here at this hour?¡± said she.

¡°Yes, my poor girl,¡± replied Morrel; ¡°I come to bring and to hear bad
tidings.¡±

¡°This is, indeed, a house of mourning,¡± said Valentine; ¡°speak,
Maximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.¡±

¡°Dear Valentine,¡± said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion,
¡°listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious. When are
you to be married?¡±

¡°I will tell you all,¡± said Valentine; ¡°from you I have nothing to
conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear
grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared
herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await
the arrival of M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, and the following day the contract will be
signed.¡±

A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and mournfully at her
he loved.

¡°Alas,¡± replied he, ¡°it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from
your own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in a few hours, will be
executed; it must be so, and I will not endeavor to prevent it. But,
since you say nothing remains but for M. d¡¯¨¦pinay to arrive that the
contract may be signed, and the following day you will be his, tomorrow
you will be engaged to M. d¡¯¨¦pinay, for he came this morning to Paris.¡±
Valentine uttered a cry.

¡°I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,¡± said Morrel; ¡°we
were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of
your grief, when a carriage rolled into the courtyard. Never, till then,
had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot help
believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that carriage I shuddered;
soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified me as much as the
footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at last opened; Albert
de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears were vain, when,
after him, another young man advanced, and the count exclaimed: ¡®Ah,
here is the Baron Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay!¡¯ I summoned all my strength and
courage to my support. Perhaps I turned pale and trembled, but certainly
I smiled; and five minutes after I left, without having heard one word
that had passed.¡±

¡°Poor Maximilian!¡± murmured Valentine.

¡°Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And remember
my life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?¡± Valentine
held down her head; she was overwhelmed.

¡°Listen,¡± said Morrel; ¡°it is not the first time you have contemplated
our present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think
it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who
like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret. There
are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for
their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend must not lose
one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow which fortune
strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune? Tell me,
Valentine for it is that I came to know.¡±

Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of
resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never
occurred to her.

¡°What do you say, Maximilian?¡± asked Valentine. ¡°What do you mean by a
struggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist my father¡¯s order,
and my dying grandmother¡¯s wish? Impossible!¡±

Morrel started.

¡°You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well
that you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need all my
strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you
say. But to grieve my father¡ªto disturb my grandmother¡¯s last
moments¡ªnever!¡±

¡°You are right,¡± said Morrel, calmly.

¡°In what a tone you speak!¡± cried Valentine.

¡°I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.¡±

¡°Mademoiselle,¡± cried Valentine; ¡°mademoiselle! Oh, selfish man! he sees
me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!¡±

¡°You mistake¡ªI understand you perfectly. You will not oppose M.
Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you will
sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.¡±

¡°But, mon Dieu! tell me, how can I do otherwise?¡±

¡°Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a
case; my selfishness will blind me,¡± replied Morrel, whose low voice and
clenched hands announced his growing desperation.

¡°What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing to
accede?¡±

¡°It is not for me to say.¡±

¡°You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.¡±

¡°Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?¡±

¡°Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you
know my devotion to you.¡±

¡°Valentine,¡± said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, ¡°give me your hand
in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused, and during
the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my
brain. Oh, if you refuse my advice¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What do you advise?¡± said Valentine, raising her eyes to heaven and
sighing.

¡°I am free,¡± replied Maximilian, ¡°and rich enough to support you. I
swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have
approached your forehead.¡±

¡°You make me tremble!¡± said the young girl.

¡°Follow me,¡± said Morrel; ¡°I will take you to my sister, who is worthy
also to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England, for America,
or, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return to Paris
when our friends have reconciled your family.¡±

Valentine shook her head.

¡°I feared it, Maximilian,¡± said she; ¡°it is the counsel of a madman, and
I should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the word
¡®Impossible, Morrel, impossible!¡¯¡±

¡°You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even
attempting to contend with it?¡± said Morrel sorrowfully.

¡°Yes,¡ªif I die!¡±

¡°Well, Valentine,¡± resumed Maximilian, ¡°I can only say again that you
are right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me that passion
blinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm reasoning. It is
then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to M.
Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay, not only by that theatrical formality invented to
heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract,
but your own will?¡±

¡°Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,¡± said Valentine, ¡°again you
plunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell me, if your
sister listened to such a proposition?¡±

¡°Mademoiselle,¡± replied Morrel with a bitter smile, ¡°I am selfish¡ªyou
have already said so¡ªand as a selfish man I think not of what others
would do in my situation, but of what I intend doing myself. I think
only that I have known you not a whole year. From the day I first saw
you, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection. One
day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that day my hope of
future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain you would be
life to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has turned
against me¡ªI had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost it. It is
an every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses
but also what he has not.¡±

Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness; Valentine looked at
him a moment with her large, scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to let
Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart.

¡°But, in a word, what are you going to do?¡± asked she.

¡°I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you, mademoiselle,
solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm, so happy,
and so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in your
memory.¡±

¡°Oh!¡± murmured Valentine.

¡°Adieu, Valentine, adieu!¡± said Morrel, bowing.

¡°Where are you going?¡± cried the young girl, extending her hand through
the opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she understood from
her own agitated feelings that her lover¡¯s calmness could not be real;
¡°where are you going?¡±

¡°I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family: and to
set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I am, may
follow.¡±

¡°Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.¡± The
young man smiled sorrowfully.

¡°Speak, speak!¡± said Valentine; ¡°I entreat you.¡±

¡°Has your resolution changed, Valentine?¡±

¡°It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!¡± cried the young
girl.

¡°Then adieu, Valentine!¡±

Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have
been supposed to be possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing
both her hands through the opening, she clasped and wrung them. ¡°I must
know what you mean to do!¡± said she. ¡°Where are you going?¡±

¡°Oh, fear not,¡± said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance, ¡°I do not
intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved
for me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke him, and to
fight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz to do with
it? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has already forgotten
he has seen me. He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by
your two families that you should be united. I have no enmity against M.
Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him.¡±

¡°On whom, then!¡ªon me?¡±

¡°On you? Valentine! Oh, Heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman one
loves is holy.¡±

¡°On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?¡±

¡°I am the only guilty person, am I not?¡± said Maximilian.

¡°Maximilian!¡± said Valentine, ¡°Maximilian, come back, I entreat you!¡±

He drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might
have thought him in his usual happy mood.

¡°Listen, my dear, my adored Valentine,¡± said he in his melodious and
grave tone; ¡°those who, like us, have never had a thought for which we
need blush before the world, such may read each other¡¯s hearts. I never
was romantic, and am no melancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred nor
Anthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has entwined
itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing so,¡ªI repeat
it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life. The moment you
leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister is happily
married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man whom the
ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer needs my
useless life. This is what I shall do; I will wait until the very moment
you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of those
unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M. Franz
may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even on the
altar as you approach it,¡ªnothing appears impossible to one condemned to
die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is
concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment, and when my misery
is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write a confidential letter
to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of police, to acquaint them
with my intention, and at the corner of some wood, on the brink of some
abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put an end to my existence, as
certainly as I am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in
France.¡±

30333m


Valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her
arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The
young man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute.

¡°Oh, for pity¡¯s sake,¡± said she, ¡°you will live, will you not?¡±

¡°No, on my honor,¡± said Maximilian; ¡°but that will not affect you. You
have done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.¡±

Valentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.
¡°Maximilian,¡± said she, ¡°Maximilian, my friend, my brother on earth, my
true husband in heaven, I entreat you, do as I do, live in suffering;
perhaps we may one day be united.¡±

¡°Adieu, Valentine,¡± repeated Morrel.

¡°My God,¡± said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven with a
sublime expression, ¡°I have done my utmost to remain a submissive
daughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded neither my
prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,¡± cried she, wiping
away her tears, and resuming her firmness, ¡°I am resolved not to die of
remorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and I will be yours. Say
when shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.¡±

Morrel, who had already gone some few steps away, again returned, and
pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening.

¡°Valentine,¡± said he, ¡°dear Valentine, you must not speak thus¡ªrather
let me die. Why should I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual?
Is it from mere humanity you bid me live? I would then rather die.¡±

¡°Truly,¡± murmured Valentine, ¡°who on this earth cares for me, if he does
not? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom do my hopes rest?
On whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him, always on him!
Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will leave the
paternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I am,¡± cried
Valentine, sobbing, ¡°I will give up all, even my dear old grandfather,
whom I had nearly forgotten.¡±

¡°No,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°you shall not leave him. M. Noirtier has
evinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you leave,
tell him all; his consent would be your justification in God¡¯s sight. As
soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead of one
child, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and how
he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,
Valentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is
happiness that awaits us.¡±

¡°Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost make me
believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father will
curse me¡ªhe is inflexible¡ªhe will never pardon me. Now listen to me,
Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident¡ªin short, if by any
means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?¡±

¡°Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this
horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged
before a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.¡±

¡°I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely, by
my mother.¡±

¡°We will wait, then,¡± said Morrel.

¡°Yes, we will wait,¡± replied Valentine, who revived at these words;
¡°there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are.¡±

¡°I rely on you, Valentine,¡± said Morrel; ¡°all you do will be well done;
only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and Madame de Saint-
M¨¦ran insist that M. d¡¯¨¦pinay should be called tomorrow to sign the
contract¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°Then you have my promise, Maximilian.¡±

¡°Instead of signing¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then, let
us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other. It is a miracle, it
is a providence that we have not been discovered. If we were surprised,
if it were known that we met thus, we should have no further resource.¡±

¡°You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?¡±

¡°From the notary, M. Deschamps.¡±

¡°I know him.¡±

¡°And for myself¡ªI will write to you, depend on me. I dread this
marriage, Maximilian, as much as you.¡±

¡°Thank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When once I
know the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over this
fence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in which
you will accompany me to my sister¡¯s; there living, retired or mingling
in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power to resist
oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep,
which only defend themselves by sighs.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Valentine, ¡°I will now acknowledge you are right,
Maximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?¡± said the
young girl sorrowfully.

¡°My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my satisfaction.¡±

Valentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the
fence, that they nearly touched those of Morrel, which were pressed
against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier.

¡°Adieu, then, till we meet again,¡± said Valentine, tearing herself away.
¡°I shall hear from you?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!¡±

The sound of a kiss was heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue.
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the
branches, and of her footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with
an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be
thus loved, and then also disappeared.

The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next
day without getting any message. It was only on the following day, at
about ten o¡¯clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.
Deschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small billet,
which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before seen her
writing. It was to this effect:

¡°Tears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for two
hours, I was at the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and for two hours
I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the
signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o¡¯clock. I
have but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged
to you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to
nine at the gate.

¡°Your betrothed,

¡°Valentine de Villefort.¡±

¡°P.S.¡ªMy poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her fever
amounted to delirium; today her delirium is almost madness. You will be
very kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in
leaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,
that the contract is to be signed this evening.¡±

Morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract
was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and
heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony, and Madame de
Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting
him; the death of M. de Saint-M¨¦ran and the dangerous illness of his
widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should
be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness.

The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, who
had left her bed to receive him, but had been obliged to return to it
immediately after.

It is easy to suppose that Morrel¡¯s agitation would not escape the
count¡¯s penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than
ever,¡ªindeed, his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on
the point of telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made to
Valentine, and kept his secret.

The young man read Valentine¡¯s letter twenty times in the course of the
day. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it he
renewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman who
has made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve from
him for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really to be
supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it is
impossible to thank and love her sufficiently.

Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine
say, ¡°Here I am, Maximilian; come and help me.¡± He had arranged
everything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field;
a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without
lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps,
as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many
precautions. Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when,
from the top of that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear
Valentine, pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had
yet only kissed the delicate hand.

When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near,
he wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question
from a friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room, and
tried to read, but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a
word, and he threw away the book, and for the second time sat down to
sketch his plan, the ladders and the fence.

At length the hour drew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the
clocks to go on peacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that
they struck eight at half-past six. He then said, ¡°It is time to start;
the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o¡¯clock, but
perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.¡± Consequently, Morrel, having
left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the
clover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking
eight. The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where
Morrel had often waited.

The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a
deeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating
heart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet
no one to be seen.

The clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was passed
in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and more
frequently through the opening. The garden became darker still, but in
the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the silence
he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The house, which was
discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no
indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage-
contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted a
quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two
or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.

This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It was
a terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the
foliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and
drew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder,
and, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step. Amidst all
these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten. ¡°It is
impossible,¡± said Maximilian, ¡°that the signing of a contract should
occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have weighed
all the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms;
something must have happened.¡±

And then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead
against the fence. Had Valentine fainted? or had she been discovered and
stopped in her flight? These were the only obstacles which appeared
possible to the young man.

The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and
that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most
impressed itself upon his mind. ¡°In that case,¡± said he, ¡°I should lose
her, and by my own fault.¡± He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it
appeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on the
ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that the
wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.

At last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his
temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg
over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He was on
Villefort¡¯s premises¡ªhad arrived there by scaling the wall. What might
be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to draw back.
He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed a path,
hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed through them,
and could see the house distinctly.

30341m


Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was
not illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on
days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a
cloud, which at that moment obscured the moon¡¯s feeble light. A light
moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor.
These three windows were in Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s room. Another
remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de
Villefort¡¯s bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order to
follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made her
describe the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it all.

This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine¡¯s
absence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture
everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the
misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and
was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when
the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon
the wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially
exposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely,
remaining perfectly motionless.

He had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak
as she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he
should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he
would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of
this hitherto incomprehensible mystery.

The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed
it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps, followed by a
gentleman in black. They descended, and advanced towards the clump of
trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor
d¡¯Avrigny.

30339m


The young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he
found himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;
there he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.

¡°Ah, my dear doctor,¡± said the procureur, ¡°Heaven declares itself
against my house! What a dreadful death¡ªwhat a blow! Seek not to console
me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow¡ªthe wound is too deep
and too fresh! Dead, dead!¡±

The cold sweat sprang to the young man¡¯s brow, and his teeth chattered.
Who could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called
accursed?

¡°My dear M. de Villefort,¡± replied the doctor, with a tone which
redoubled the terror of the young man, ¡°I have not led you here to
console you; on the contrary¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What can you mean?¡± asked the procureur, alarmed.

¡°I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you, there
is another, perhaps, still greater.¡±

¡°Can it be possible?¡± murmured Villefort, clasping his hands. ¡°What are
you going to tell me?¡±

¡°Are we quite alone, my friend?¡±

¡°Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?¡±

¡°Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,¡± said the
doctor. ¡°Let us sit down.¡±

Villefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before him,
with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported his
head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its
beatings should be heard. ¡°Dead, dead!¡± repeated he within himself; and
he felt as if he were also dying.

¡°Speak, doctor¡ªI am listening,¡± said Villefort; ¡°strike¡ªI am prepared
for everything!¡±

¡°Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she
enjoyed excellent health.¡± Morrel began again to breathe freely, which
he had not done during the last ten minutes.

¡°Grief has consumed her,¡± said Villefort¡ª¡°yes, grief, doctor! After
living forty years with the marquis¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°It is not grief, my dear Villefort,¡± said the doctor; ¡°grief may kill,
although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in
ten minutes.¡± Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head,
which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with
amazement.

¡°Were you present during the last struggle?¡± asked M. d¡¯Avrigny.

¡°I was,¡± replied the procureur; ¡°you begged me not to leave.¡±

¡°Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de Saint-
M¨¦ran has fallen a victim?¡±

¡°I did. Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran had three successive attacks, at intervals
of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When you
arrived, Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran had already been panting for breath some
minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous attack,
and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and her limbs
and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then I
understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had
thought. This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could
not. You held her hand¡ªyou were feeling her pulse¡ªand the second fit
came on before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than
the first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth
contracted and turned purple.¡±

¡°And at the third she expired.¡±

¡°At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you
confirmed my opinion.¡±

¡°Yes, before others,¡± replied the doctor; ¡°but now we are alone¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!¡±

¡°That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are
the same.¡±

M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down again,
silent and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake.

¡°Listen,¡± said the doctor; ¡°I know the full importance of the statement
I have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I have made
it.¡±

¡°Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?¡± asked Villefort.

¡°As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity in
the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so
great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I
should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate,
but to a friend. And to that friend I say, ¡®During the three-quarters of
an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the convulsions and the
death of Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, and am thoroughly convinced that not
only did her death proceed from poison, but I could also specify the
poison.¡¯¡±

¡°Can it be possible?¡±

¡°The symptoms are marked, do you see?¡ªsleep broken by nervous spasms,
excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de Saint-
M¨¦ran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine, which by
some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.¡±

Villefort seized the doctor¡¯s hand.

¡°Oh, it is impossible,¡± said he, ¡°I must be dreaming! It is frightful to
hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my dear
doctor, that you may be deceived.¡±

¡°Doubtless I may, but¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°But?¡±

30345m


¡°But I do not think so.¡±

¡°Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me
lately that I am on the verge of madness.¡±

¡°Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Has anything been sent for from a chemist¡¯s that I have not examined?¡±

¡°Nothing.¡±

¡°Had Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran any enemies?¡±

¡°Not to my knowledge.¡±

¡°Would her death affect anyone¡¯s interest?¡±

¡°It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress¡ªValentine alone.
Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to
punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.¡±

¡°Indeed, my dear friend,¡± said M. d¡¯Avrigny, ¡°I would not accuse anyone;
I speak only of an accident, you understand,¡ªof a mistake,¡ªbut whether
accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience and
compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.¡±

¡°Of whom?¡ªhow?¡ªof what?¡±

¡°May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given
Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran a dose prepared for his master?¡±

¡°For my father?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de Saint-
M¨¦ran?¡±

¡°Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain
diseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every
other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved
to try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him
brucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six
grains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the
paralyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed to
it, would be sufficient to kill another person.¡±

¡°My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier¡¯s
apartment and that of Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, and Barrois never entered
my mother-in-law¡¯s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the
most conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost
reliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this
axiom, errare humanum est.¡±

¡°Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with
myself?¡±

¡°Why do you ask me that?¡ªwhat do you wish?¡±

¡°Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult
together, and examine the body.¡±

¡°And you will find traces of poison?¡±

¡°No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of the
body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall say,
¡®Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence, watch over
your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.¡¯¡±

¡°What do you propose to me, d¡¯Avrigny?¡± said Villefort in despair; ¡°so
soon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become
necessary; and an inquest in my house¡ªimpossible! Still,¡± continued the
procureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, ¡°if you wish it¡ªif you
demand it, why then it shall be done. But, doctor, you see me already so
grieved¡ªhow can I introduce into my house so much scandal, after so much
sorrow? My wife and my daughter would die of it! And I, doctor¡ªyou know
a man does not arrive at the post I occupy¡ªone has not been king¡¯s
attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of
enemies; mine are numerous. Let this affair be talked of, it will be a
triumph for them, which will make them rejoice, and cover me with shame.
Pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were you a priest I should not
dare tell you that, but you are a man, and you know mankind. Doctor,
pray recall your words; you have said nothing, have you?¡±

¡°My dear M. de Villefort,¡± replied the doctor, ¡°my first duty is to
humanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran, if science could
have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us
bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am
willing, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject
should be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch always¡ªwatch
carefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have
found the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, ¡®You are a
magistrate, do as you will!¡¯¡±

¡°I thank you, doctor,¡± said Villefort with indescribable joy; ¡°I never
had a better friend than you.¡± And, as if he feared Doctor d¡¯Avrigny
would recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.

When they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the
moon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken for
that of a ghost.

¡°I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible
manner,¡± said he; ¡°but Valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so much
sorrow?¡±

As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red
curtains and the three windows with white curtains. The light had almost
disappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put
out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the
window. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he saw one of
the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the mantle-piece threw
some of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen for one moment on
the balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a sob.

It cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but now
disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was
weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although it
was impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he
thought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind
told him so. This double error became an irresistible reality, and by
one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his
hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the
risk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some
exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-
garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and
having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the
house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which
opened without offering any resistance.

Valentine had not seen him. Her eyes, raised towards heaven, were
watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure, its form that of a
shadow mounting towards heaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it
as the soul of her grandmother.

Meanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,
which, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had
regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort
even would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such
encounter. He would at once approach Valentine¡¯s father and acknowledge
all, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two
fond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad.

Happily he did not meet anyone. Now, especially, did he find the
description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to
him; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was
feeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take. He turned
back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to hear the
voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the door open and entered. At the
other end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay the
corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so
unexpectedly overheard. By its side, on her knees, and with her head
buried in the cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and
sobbing, her hands extended above her head, clasped and stiff. She had
turned from the window, which remained open, and was praying in accents
that would have affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid,
incoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost
stopped her utterance.

The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn
paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene. Morrel could not
resist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily
impressed, but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before
him, was more than he could bear in silence. He sighed, and whispered a
name, and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of
the chair¡ªa head like that of a Magdalen by Correggio¡ªwas raised and
turned towards him. Valentine perceived him without betraying the least
surprise. A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to
minor emotions. Morrel held out his hand to her. Valentine, as her only
apology for not having met him, pointed to the corpse under the sheet,
and began to sob again.

Neither dared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to
break the silence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine
ventured.

¡°My friend,¡± said she, ¡°how came you here? Alas, I would say you are
welcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.¡±

¡°Valentine,¡± said Morrel with a trembling voice, ¡°I had waited since
half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the
wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the
fatal event¡ª¡ª¡±

¡°What voices?¡± asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought of the
conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could
see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple
lips.

¡°Your servants,¡± said he, ¡°who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful
story; from them I learned it all.¡±

¡°But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.¡±

¡°Forgive me,¡± replied Morrel; ¡°I will go away.¡±

¡°No,¡± said Valentine, ¡°you might meet someone; stay.¡±

¡°But if anyone should come here¡ª¡ª¡±

The young girl shook her head. ¡°No one will come,¡± said she; ¡°do not
fear, there is our safeguard,¡± pointing to the bed.

¡°But what has become of M. d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡± replied Morrel.

30349m


¡°M. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was
dying.¡±

¡°Alas,¡± said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this
death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.

¡°But what redoubles my sorrow,¡± continued the young girl, as if this
feeling was to receive its immediate punishment, ¡°is that the poor old
lady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might take place as
soon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was acting against
me.¡±

¡°Hark!¡± said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly heard in
the corridor and on the stairs.

¡°It is my father, who has just left his study.¡±

¡°To accompany the doctor to the door,¡± added Morrel.

¡°How do you know it is the doctor?¡± asked Valentine, astonished.

¡°I imagined it must be,¡± said Morrel.

Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close,
then M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs. He
stopped a moment in the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to
his own apartment or into Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s; Morrel concealed
himself behind a door; Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to
deprive her of all fear. M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.

¡°Now,¡± said Valentine, ¡°you can neither go out by the front door nor by
the garden.¡±

Morrel looked at her with astonishment.

¡°There is but one way left you that is safe,¡± said she; ¡°it is through
my grandfather¡¯s room.¡± She rose. ¡°Come,¡± she added.

¡°Where?¡± asked Maximilian.

¡°To my grandfather¡¯s room.¡±

¡°I in M. Noirtier¡¯s apartment?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Can you mean it, Valentine?¡±

¡°I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need
his help,¡ªcome.¡±

¡°Be careful, Valentine,¡± said Morrel, hesitating to comply with the
young girl¡¯s wishes; ¡°I now see my error¡ªI acted like a madman in coming
in here. Are you sure you are more reasonable?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Valentine; ¡°and I have but one scruple,¡ªthat of leaving my
dear grandmother¡¯s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.¡±

¡°Valentine,¡± said Morrel, ¡°death is in itself sacred.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Valentine; ¡°besides, it will not be for long.¡±

She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase
to M. Noirtier¡¯s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they
found the old servant.

¡°Barrois,¡± said Valentine, ¡°shut the door, and let no one come in.¡±

She passed first.

Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was
watching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was
something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which
struck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate.

¡°Dear grandfather.¡± said she hurriedly, ¡°you know poor grandmamma died
an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.¡±

His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.

¡°To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?¡±

The paralytic motioned ¡°Yes.¡±

Valentine took Maximilian¡¯s hand.

¡°Look attentively, then, at this gentleman.¡±

The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on
Morrel.

¡°It is M. Maximilian Morrel,¡± said she; ¡°the son of that good merchant
of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said the old man.

¡°He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render
glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of
the Legion of Honor.¡±

The old man signified that he recollected him.

¡°Well, grandpapa,¡± said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to
Maximilian, ¡°I love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry
another, I would destroy myself.¡±

The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.

¡°You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?¡± asked Valentine.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my
father?¡±

Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say, ¡°perhaps I
may.¡±

Maximilian understood him.

¡°Mademoiselle,¡± said he, ¡°you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your
deceased grandmother¡¯s room, will you allow me the honor of a few
minutes¡¯ conversation with M. Noirtier?¡±

¡°That is it,¡± said the old man¡¯s eye. Then he looked anxiously at
Valentine.

¡°Do you fear he will not understand?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°Oh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I talk to
you.¡± Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile; although
shaded by sorrow,¡ª¡°He knows everything I know,¡± said she.

Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to
admit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and
sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier
that he was in Valentine¡¯s confidence and knew all their secrets, Morrel
took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all on a
table where there was a light.

¡°But first,¡± said Morrel, ¡°allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how much
I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting her.¡±

Noirtier made a sign that he would listen.

It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere
useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of the
lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably noble
and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with
trembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with
Valentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her solitude
and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He told him
his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when he
consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, ¡°That is good,
proceed.¡±

¡°And now,¡± said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his
recital, ¡°now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you
of my intentions?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± signified the old man.

¡°This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in
which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister¡¯s house, to marry
her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort¡¯s pardon.¡±

¡°No,¡± said Noirtier.

¡°We must not do so?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°You do not sanction our project?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°There is another way,¡± said Morrel. The old man¡¯s interrogative eye
said, ¡°Which?¡±

¡°I will go,¡± continued Maximilian, ¡°I will seek M. Franz d¡¯¨¦pinay¡ªI am
happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort¡¯s
absence¡ªand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to
challenge me.¡± Noirtier¡¯s look continued to interrogate.

¡°You wish to know what I will do?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind me
to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by
renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure
my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through
interest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would
be forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no
other, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall kill
him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry
Valentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.¡±

Noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere
countenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,
adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to
a sound and faithful drawing.

Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which
was his manner of saying ¡°No.¡±

¡°No?¡± said Morrel; ¡°you disapprove of this second project, as you did of
the first?¡±

¡°I do,¡± signified the old man.

¡°But what then must be done?¡± asked Morrel. ¡°Madame de Saint-M¨¦ran¡¯s
last request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must I let
things take their course?¡± Noirtier did not move. ¡°I understand,¡± said
Morrel; ¡°I am to wait.¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°But delay may ruin our plan, sir,¡± replied the young man. ¡°Alone,
Valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I am here
almost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to
occur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I have proposed to
you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do you authorize
Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Do you prefer I should seek M. d¡¯¨¦pinay?¡±

¡°No.¡±

¡°Whence then will come the help we need¡ªfrom chance?¡± resumed Morrel.

¡°No.¡±

¡°From you?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life
depends on your answer. Will our help come from you?¡±

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°You are sure of it?¡±

¡°Yes.¡± There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer, no
one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.

¡°Oh, thank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should
restore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained
to that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?¡± A smile
lit up the old man¡¯s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed
face.

¡°Then I must wait?¡± asked the young man.

¡°Yes.¡±

¡°But the contract?¡± The same smile returned. ¡°Will you assure me it
shall not be signed?¡±

¡°Yes,¡± said Noirtier.

¡°The contract shall not be signed!¡± cried Morrel. ¡°Oh, pardon me, sir; I
can scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not sign it?¡±

¡°No,¡± said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance, Morrel still
hesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,
instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate
from enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of
his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks of
burdens he can raise, the timi
